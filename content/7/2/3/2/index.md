## 2.3.2 Current Yield

In the realm of fixed income securities, understanding the various yield measures is crucial for investors seeking to optimize their portfolios. Among these measures, the **current yield** is a fundamental concept that provides insight into the income generated by a bond relative to its market price. This section delves into the intricacies of current yield, offering a comprehensive understanding that is essential for both novice and seasoned investors.

### Definition of Current Yield

The **current yield** of a bond is defined as the bond's annual coupon payment divided by its current market price. It is a straightforward calculation that provides investors with a snapshot of the bond's income-generating potential relative to its price.

**Formula for Current Yield:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}}
{{< /katex >}}

- **Annual Coupon Payment:** The total interest payment received by the bondholder over a year, typically expressed as a percentage of the bond's face value.
- **Current Market Price:** The price at which the bond is currently trading in the market.

### Understanding Current Yield

Current yield is a useful measure for evaluating the income aspect of a bond investment. However, it is important to note that it does not account for any capital gains or losses that may occur if the bond is held to maturity. This makes current yield particularly relevant for investors who are primarily interested in the income component of their investments rather than the total return.

### Example of Current Yield Calculation

Consider a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a current market price of $950. The annual coupon payment is $50 (5% of $1,000). To calculate the current yield:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{50}{950} \approx 5.26\%
{{< /katex >}}

In this example, the bond's current yield is 5.26%, indicating the income return an investor can expect based on the current market price.

### Current Yield vs. Yield to Maturity (YTM)

While current yield provides a quick view of a bond's income relative to its price, it is not as comprehensive as the **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**. YTM accounts for the total return of the bond if held to maturity, considering both the coupon payments and any capital gain or loss incurred when the bond matures at its face value.

#### Example Comparison

Let's revisit our earlier example. Suppose the bond matures in 5 years, and its YTM is calculated to be 6%. This means that if the investor holds the bond until maturity, the overall annualized return, including interest payments and the return of principal, would be 6%.

- **Current Yield:** 5.26%
- **Yield to Maturity:** 6%

This comparison highlights that while the current yield offers a snapshot of income, it does not reflect the bond's total expected return.

### Practical Applications of Current Yield

1. **Income-Focused Investing:** Investors seeking regular income can use current yield to compare different bonds and select those that offer higher income relative to their market price.

2. **Market Conditions Insight:** Changes in current yield can indicate shifts in market conditions. For example, if bond prices fall due to rising interest rates, current yields will increase, reflecting higher income potential.

3. **Portfolio Diversification:** By analyzing current yields across various bonds, investors can diversify their portfolios to balance income and risk.

### Limitations of Current Yield

- **Excludes Capital Gains/Losses:** Current yield does not account for changes in bond value at maturity, which can be significant if the bond is purchased at a discount or premium.
- **Not Suitable for Total Return Analysis:** Investors focused on total return should consider YTM or other comprehensive yield measures.
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Current yield does not reflect the bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes, which can impact the bond's market price and overall return.

### Real-World Scenario

Imagine an investor holding a portfolio of bonds with varying current yields. By regularly reviewing the current yields, the investor can adjust their holdings to optimize income in response to changing interest rates or economic conditions. For instance, during periods of rising interest rates, the investor might shift to bonds with higher current yields to maintain income levels.

### Conclusion

Current yield is a vital tool for investors focusing on the income aspect of bond investments. While it provides a clear view of income relative to market price, it should be used in conjunction with other yield measures, such as YTM, to gain a comprehensive understanding of a bond's total return potential. By mastering the concept of current yield, investors can make informed decisions that align with their income objectives and market expectations.

{{< quizdown >}}

### What is the formula for calculating the current yield of a bond?

- [x] Annual coupon payment divided by current market price
- [ ] Annual coupon payment divided by face value
- [ ] Current market price divided by annual coupon payment
- [ ] Face value divided by annual coupon payment

> **Explanation:** The current yield is calculated by dividing the annual coupon payment by the bond's current market price, providing a snapshot of the bond's income relative to its price.

### Which of the following best describes the current yield?

- [ ] It accounts for capital gains or losses at maturity.
- [x] It provides a snapshot of income relative to price.
- [ ] It is the same as Yield to Maturity (YTM).
- [ ] It measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes.

> **Explanation:** Current yield provides a snapshot of the income generated by a bond relative to its market price but does not account for capital gains or losses at maturity.

### If a bond has a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 4%, and a current market price of $950, what is its current yield?

- [ ] 4.00%
- [x] 4.21%
- [ ] 5.00%
- [ ] 4.50%

> **Explanation:** The annual coupon payment is $40 (4% of $1,000). The current yield is calculated as $40 divided by $950, which equals approximately 4.21%.

### Why might an investor prefer to use current yield over Yield to Maturity (YTM)?

- [ ] To account for capital gains or losses
- [x] To focus on the income aspect of the investment
- [ ] To measure total return
- [ ] To assess interest rate risk

> **Explanation:** An investor might prefer current yield when they are primarily interested in the income aspect of the investment rather than the total return.

### How does a rise in interest rates generally affect the current yield of existing bonds?

- [x] It increases the current yield.
- [ ] It decreases the current yield.
- [ ] It has no effect on the current yield.
- [ ] It makes the current yield equal to YTM.

> **Explanation:** A rise in interest rates typically leads to a decrease in bond prices, which increases the current yield as the annual coupon payment becomes a larger percentage of the lower market price.

### What is one limitation of using current yield as a measure of bond performance?

- [ ] It includes capital gains and losses.
- [ ] It measures total return.
- [x] It does not account for capital gains or losses.
