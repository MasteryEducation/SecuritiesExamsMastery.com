## 2.2.3 Pricing Conventions and Accrued Interest

Understanding the pricing conventions and accrued interest in bond markets is crucial for anyone involved in fixed income securities, whether you're an investor, a finance professional, or a student preparing for US Securities Exams. This section will delve into the differences between clean and dirty prices, the calculation of accrued interest, and the significance of these concepts in trading and settlement.

### Clean Price vs. Dirty Price

In the bond market, prices are often quoted in two ways: the clean price and the dirty price. Understanding the distinction between these two is fundamental to bond trading and valuation.

#### Clean Price

The **clean price** of a bond is the price excluding any accrued interest. It represents the bond's value based purely on its coupon payments and principal repayment, disregarding any interest that has accumulated since the last coupon payment. This is the price typically quoted in financial markets, as it reflects the bond's intrinsic value without the complication of interim interest.

#### Dirty Price

The **dirty price**, also known as the invoice price, includes the accrued interest in addition to the clean price. This is the actual amount the buyer pays to the seller when purchasing a bond, as it accounts for the interest that has accrued since the last coupon payment. The dirty price is essential for determining the total cost of acquiring a bond and is used in the settlement process.

### Accrued Interest Explained

**Accrued interest** is the interest that accumulates on a bond between coupon payment dates. Since bonds typically pay interest semi-annually, there is a period during which interest accrues daily. When a bond is sold, the buyer compensates the seller for this accrued interest, ensuring that the seller receives the interest earned up to the sale date.

#### Why Accrued Interest is Added

Accrued interest is added to the bond's price to ensure fairness between the buyer and seller. If a bond is sold between coupon payments, the seller is entitled to the interest earned up to the sale date. The buyer, in turn, will receive the full coupon payment at the next payment date, which includes interest for the entire period. Therefore, the buyer pays the accrued interest to the seller to account for the interest earned during the holding period.

### Calculating Accrued Interest

Accrued interest is calculated using day-count conventions, which define how interest accrues over time. Different bonds may use different conventions, and understanding these is essential for accurate interest calculations.

#### Day-Count Conventions

Day-count conventions are methods used to calculate the amount of interest accrued on a bond between coupon payments. They vary based on the type of bond and the market in which it trades. The most common conventions include:

- **Actual/Actual (ACT/ACT):** This convention uses the actual number of days in the interest period and the actual number of days in the year. It is commonly used for U.S. Treasury securities.
  
- **30/360:** This convention assumes a 30-day month and a 360-day year, simplifying calculations. It is often used for corporate and municipal bonds.

- **Actual/360:** This method uses the actual number of days in the interest period but assumes a 360-day year. It is frequently used in money market instruments.

- **Actual/365:** Similar to Actual/360, but assumes a 365-day year. It is less common but used in some markets.

#### Example Calculations

Let's calculate accrued interest using different day-count conventions for a bond with a 6% annual coupon rate, a face value of $1,000, and a semi-annual coupon payment. Assume the last coupon payment was made 60 days ago, and the bond uses the 30/360 day-count convention.

1. **30/360 Convention:**
   - Days since last payment: 60
   - Days in period: 180 (assumed 6 months)
   - Accrued Interest = (Coupon Rate / 2) × (Days Since Last Payment / Days in Period) × Face Value
   - Accrued Interest = (0.06 / 2) × (60 / 180) × $1,000 = $10

2. **Actual/Actual Convention:**
   - Days since last payment: 60
   - Days in period: 182 (actual days in 6 months)
   - Accrued Interest = (0.06 / 2) × (60 / 182) × $1,000 ≈ $9.89

3. **Actual/360 Convention:**
   - Days since last payment: 60
   - Days in period: 180 (actual days)
   - Accrued Interest = (0.06 / 2) × (60 / 180) × $1,000 = $10

### Significance in Trading and Settlement

Understanding pricing conventions and accrued interest is critical in trading and settlement. The clean price is used for quoting and trading purposes, while the dirty price is essential for settlement, as it reflects the total amount paid by the buyer.

#### Trading Implications

- **Quoted Prices:** Traders often quote the clean price to focus on the bond's yield and market value without the influence of accrued interest.
- **Settlement Amounts:** The dirty price is used to determine the settlement amount, ensuring that the seller is compensated for accrued interest.

#### Settlement Process

During the settlement process, the buyer pays the dirty price, which includes the clean price plus accrued interest. This ensures that the seller receives compensation for the interest earned during the holding period. The settlement date is typically two business days after the trade date, known as T+2.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

Consider a scenario where an investor purchases a bond with a face value of $1,000, a 5% annual coupon rate, and a semi-annual coupon payment. The bond was purchased 45 days after the last coupon payment, and the 30/360 day-count convention is used.

- **Clean Price Quoted:** $980
- **Accrued Interest Calculation:**
  - Days since last payment: 45
  - Days in period: 180
  - Accrued Interest = (0.05 / 2) × (45 / 180) × $1,000 = $6.25
- **Dirty Price (Invoice Price):** $980 + $6.25 = $986.25

In this example, the investor pays $986.25, which includes the clean price of $980 and the accrued interest of $6.25.

### Importance for Exam Preparation

For those preparing for US Securities Exams, understanding pricing conventions and accrued interest is vital. These concepts are frequently tested, and proficiency in calculating accrued interest using various day-count conventions is essential. Practice problems and exercises will help reinforce these skills.

### Summary

In summary, the distinction between clean and dirty prices, the role of accrued interest, and the application of day-count conventions are fundamental to mastering bond pricing and valuation. These concepts not only facilitate fair trading and settlement but also enhance your ability to navigate the complexities of the bond market.
