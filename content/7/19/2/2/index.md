## B.2 Duration and Convexity Formulas

In the realm of fixed income securities, understanding the concepts of duration and convexity is crucial for evaluating the interest rate risk and price sensitivity of bonds. These metrics provide investors with insights into how bond prices are likely to change with shifts in interest rates, enabling more informed investment decisions. This section delves into the formulas and calculations for Macaulay Duration, Modified Duration, Effective Duration, and Convexity, offering a comprehensive guide to mastering these essential tools.

### Understanding Duration

Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates. It reflects the weighted average time it takes for a bond's cash flows to be paid. Duration is a critical tool for assessing interest rate risk, as it provides an estimate of how much a bond's price will change in response to a 1% change in interest rates.

#### Macaulay Duration

Macaulay Duration is the weighted average time to receive the bond's cash flows, where the weights are the present values of the cash flows. It is expressed in years and provides a time-based measure of a bond's interest rate risk.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} 
\text{Macaulay Duration} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{t \cdot C_t}{(1 + y)^t} \right)}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{C_t}{(1 + y)^t} \right)} 
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( C_t \\) = Cash flow at time \\( t \\)
- \\( y \\) = Yield to maturity
- \\( n \\) = Total number of periods

**Sample Calculation:**

Consider a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a maturity of 3 years. The bond pays annual coupons, and the yield to maturity is 4%.

1. **Calculate Cash Flows:**
   - Year 1: $50
   - Year 2: $50
   - Year 3: $1,050 (includes face value)

2. **Calculate Present Values:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{PV}_1 = \frac{50}{(1 + 0.04)^1} = 48.08
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\text{PV}_2 = \frac{50}{(1 + 0.04)^2} = 46.23
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\text{PV}_3 = \frac{1050}{(1 + 0.04)^3} = 933.51
{{< /katex >}}

3. **Calculate Weighted Present Values:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Weighted PV}_1 = 1 \times 48.08 = 48.08
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\text{Weighted PV}_2 = 2 \times 46.23 = 92.46
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\text{Weighted PV}_3 = 3 \times 933.51 = 2800.53
{{< /katex >}}

4. **Sum of Weighted Present Values:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Sum of Weighted PVs} = 48.08 + 92.46 + 2800.53 = 2941.07
{{< /katex >}}

5. **Sum of Present Values:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Sum of PVs} = 48.08 + 46.23 + 933.51 = 1027.82
{{< /katex >}}

6. **Calculate Macaulay Duration:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Macaulay Duration} = \frac{2941.07}{1027.82} = 2.86 \text{ years}
{{< /katex >}}

#### Modified Duration

Modified Duration adjusts the Macaulay Duration to account for changes in yield, providing a more accurate measure of a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} 
\text{Modified Duration} = \frac{\text{Macaulay Duration}}{1 + \frac{y}{m}} 
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( m \\) = Number of compounding periods per year

**Sample Calculation:**

Using the Macaulay Duration from the previous example (2.86 years) and a yield of 4%:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Modified Duration} = \frac{2.86}{1 + \frac{0.04}{1}} = \frac{2.86}{1.04} = 2.75
{{< /katex >}}

### Effective Duration

Effective Duration is used for bonds with embedded options, such as callable or putable bonds. It measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates, considering changes in cash flow patterns due to the options.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} 
\text{Effective Duration} = \frac{P_{-} - P_{+}}{2 \times P_0 \times \Delta y} 
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( P_{-} \\) = Price if yield decreases
- \\( P_{+} \\) = Price if yield increases
- \\( P_0 \\) = Initial price
- \\( \Delta y \\) = Change in yield

**Sample Calculation:**

Suppose a bond's price is $1000, and if the yield decreases by 0.5%, the price rises to $1020. If the yield increases by 0.5%, the price falls to $980.

{{< katex >}}
\text{Effective Duration} = \frac{1020 - 980}{2 \times 1000 \times 0.005} = \frac{40}{10} = 4
{{< /katex >}}

### Understanding Convexity

Convexity measures the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and yields, providing a more accurate estimate of price changes for larger interest rate movements. It complements duration by accounting for the non-linear nature of price-yield changes.

#### Convexity Formula

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} 
\text{Convexity} = \frac{1}{P_0} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{C_t \cdot t \cdot (t + 1)}{(1 + y)^{t+2}} \right) 
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( C_t \\) = Cash flow at time \\( t \\)
- \\( y \\) = Yield to maturity
- \\( n \\) = Total number of periods
- \\( P_0 \\) = Initial price

**Sample Calculation:**

Using the bond from the Macaulay Duration example:

1. **Calculate Convexity:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Convexity} = \frac{1}{1027.82} \left( \frac{50 \times 1 \times 2}{(1 + 0.04)^{3}} + \frac{50 \times 2 \times 3}{(1 + 0.04)^{4}} + \frac{1050 \times 3 \times 4}{(1 + 0.04)^{5}} \right)
{{< /katex >}}

2. **Calculate Each Term:**

{{< katex >}}
\frac{50 \times 1 \times 2}{(1 + 0.04)^{3}} = 92.31
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\frac{50 \times 2 \times 3}{(1 + 0.04)^{4}} = 277.78
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\frac{1050 \times 3 \times 4}{(1 + 0.04)^{5}} = 11200.96
{{< /katex >}}

3. **Sum the Terms:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Sum of Terms} = 92.31 + 277.78 + 11200.96 = 11571.05
{{< /katex >}}

4. **Calculate Convexity:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Convexity} = \frac{11571.05}{1027.82} = 11.26
{{< /katex >}}

### Practical Applications

Understanding and calculating duration and convexity are crucial for several reasons:

- **Interest Rate Risk Management:** Duration and convexity help investors manage interest rate risk by providing insights into how bond prices will react to changes in interest rates.
- **Portfolio Immunization:** Investors can use duration matching to immunize portfolios against interest rate changes, ensuring that the portfolio's duration aligns with the investment horizon.
- **Pricing and Valuation:** These metrics are essential for pricing and valuing bonds, especially those with embedded options, where cash flows may change with interest rate movements.

### Real-World Examples

Consider a portfolio manager who needs to assess the interest rate risk of a bond portfolio. By calculating the duration and convexity of each bond, the manager can estimate the portfolio's overall sensitivity to interest rate changes and make informed decisions about hedging or adjusting the portfolio's composition.

### Regulatory Considerations

In the context of U.S. securities regulations, understanding duration and convexity is vital for compliance with risk management standards set by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). These concepts are integral to assessing the risk profile of fixed income securities and ensuring that investment strategies align with regulatory guidelines.

### Conclusion

Mastering the concepts of duration and convexity is essential for anyone involved in fixed income investing. By understanding these metrics, you can better manage interest rate risk, optimize investment strategies, and comply with regulatory requirements. Whether you're preparing for the US Securities Exams or enhancing your professional practice, these tools are invaluable for navigating the complexities of bond markets.
