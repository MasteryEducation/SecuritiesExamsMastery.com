## 5.3.2 Calculating Convexity

Understanding convexity is crucial for anyone involved in bond markets, whether you are an investor, finance professional, or student preparing for US Securities Exams. Convexity provides a more comprehensive view of how bond prices are affected by changes in interest rates, supplementing the information provided by duration. In this section, we will delve into the definition of convexity, explore the formula used to calculate it, and demonstrate its application through practical examples.

### What is Convexity?

Convexity is a measure of the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and yields. While duration provides a linear approximation of how bond prices change with interest rate movements, convexity accounts for the fact that this relationship is actually curved. This curvature means that as interest rates change, the price change predicted by duration alone may not be entirely accurate. Convexity helps to adjust for this non-linearity, providing a more accurate estimate of bond price sensitivity to interest rate changes.

#### Glossary: Convexity

- **Convexity:** A measure of the sensitivity of the duration of a bond to changes in interest rates. It indicates the degree to which the duration of a bond changes as interest rates change.

### The Convexity Formula

The convexity of a bond is calculated using the following formula:

{{< katex >}} 
\text{Convexity} = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{C_t}{(1+y)^{t+2}} \times t(t+1) \right)
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( P \\) is the price of the bond.
- \\( C_t \\) is the cash flow at time \\( t \\) (coupon payment or principal repayment).
- \\( y \\) is the yield to maturity of the bond.
- \\( t \\) is the time period (usually in years).

This formula calculates the weighted average of the times at which cash flows are received, adjusted for the present value of those cash flows.

### Step-by-Step Calculation of Convexity

To illustrate the calculation of convexity, let's consider a simple example:

**Example Bond Data:**
- Face Value: $1,000
- Annual Coupon Rate: 5%
- Maturity: 3 years
- Yield to Maturity (YTM): 4%

**Step 1: Calculate Cash Flows**

The bond pays an annual coupon of 5% on its face value, resulting in annual cash flows of $50. At maturity, the bond also repays the face value of $1,000. Thus, the cash flows are:
- Year 1: $50
- Year 2: $50
- Year 3: $1,050 (coupon + principal)

**Step 2: Calculate Present Value of Cash Flows**

Using the yield to maturity (YTM) of 4%, calculate the present value of each cash flow:

{{< katex >}}
PV_{Year 1} = \frac{50}{(1+0.04)^1} = 48.08
{{< /katex >}}
{{< katex >}}
PV_{Year 2} = \frac{50}{(1+0.04)^2} = 46.23
{{< /katex >}}
{{< katex >}}
PV_{Year 3} = \frac{1050}{(1+0.04)^3} = 933.51
{{< /katex >}}

**Step 3: Calculate Bond Price**

The price of the bond is the sum of the present values of all cash flows:

{{< katex >}}
P = 48.08 + 46.23 + 933.51 = 1027.82
{{< /katex >}}

**Step 4: Calculate Convexity**

Now, apply the convexity formula:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Convexity} = \frac{1}{1027.82} \left( \frac{50 \times 1 \times 2}{(1+0.04)^{3}} + \frac{50 \times 2 \times 3}{(1+0.04)^{4}} + \frac{1050 \times 3 \times 4}{(1+0.04)^{5}} \right)
{{< /katex >}}

Calculating each term:

{{< katex >}}
\frac{50 \times 1 \times 2}{(1+0.04)^{3}} = \frac{100}{1.124864} = 88.92
{{< /katex >}}
{{< katex >}}
\frac{50 \times 2 \times 3}{(1+0.04)^{4}} = \frac{300}{1.169858} = 256.37
{{< /katex >}}
{{< katex >}}
\frac{1050 \times 3 \times 4}{(1+0.04)^{5}} = \frac{12600}{1.217104} = 10354.46
{{< /katex >}}

Summing these values and dividing by the bond price:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Convexity} = \frac{1}{1027.82} \times (88.92 + 256.37 + 10354.46) = \frac{1}{1027.82} \times 10699.75 = 10.41
{{< /katex >}}

This convexity value indicates the bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes beyond what duration alone can predict.

### The Role of Convexity in Bond Pricing

Convexity is particularly important for large interest rate changes. While duration provides a linear estimate of bond price change, convexity accounts for the curvature, thus refining the estimate. When interest rates fall, bonds with higher convexity will experience larger price increases compared to bonds with lower convexity. Conversely, when rates rise, bonds with higher convexity will have smaller price decreases.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

Convexity is a critical tool for portfolio managers and investors. It helps in constructing portfolios that are less sensitive to interest rate changes. For instance, in a rising interest rate environment, investors might prefer bonds with lower convexity to minimize price volatility. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, bonds with higher convexity might be favored to maximize price gains.

### Example: Comparing Two Bonds

Consider two bonds, A and B, both with the same duration but different convexities. If interest rates decrease by 1%, bond A with higher convexity will see a greater price increase than bond B. This is due to the additional price sensitivity captured by convexity.

### Conclusion

Understanding and calculating convexity is essential for accurately assessing the interest rate risk and potential price volatility of bonds. By supplementing duration with convexity, investors and finance professionals can make more informed decisions, optimizing their investment strategies in the fixed income markets.
