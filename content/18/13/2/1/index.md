## 13.2.1 Required Records

In the securities industry, maintaining accurate and comprehensive records is not just a best practice; it is a regulatory requirement. Broker-dealers and registered representatives (RRs) are obligated to adhere to stringent recordkeeping standards as outlined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This section will delve into the types of records that must be maintained, the specific documents involved, and the importance of supervisory procedures to ensure compliance.

### Importance of Recordkeeping

Recordkeeping is the backbone of compliance in the securities industry. It ensures transparency, accountability, and the ability to verify transactions and communications. Proper recordkeeping supports regulatory audits and investigations, helps resolve disputes, and protects both the firm and its clients. Inadequate or inaccurate records can lead to regulatory sanctions, fines, and reputational damage.

### Types of Required Records

Broker-dealers and RRs must maintain a variety of records to comply with regulatory requirements. These records can be broadly categorized into customer account records, transaction records, communications with clients, and financial and operational reports. Each category serves a distinct purpose in ensuring the integrity and transparency of financial activities.

#### Customer Account Records

Customer account records are essential for tracking client interactions and financial activities. These records typically include:

- **New Account Forms**: These documents capture essential information about the client, including personal details, financial status, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. They serve as the foundation for making suitable investment recommendations.

- **Account Statements**: Periodic account statements provide a summary of the client's holdings, transactions, and account value. They are crucial for clients to monitor their investments and for firms to demonstrate transparency.

- **Customer Identification Program (CIP) Records**: As part of anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, firms must verify the identity of their clients. CIP records include documentation used to verify identity, such as government-issued IDs.

- **Beneficial Ownership Records**: For certain accounts, firms must maintain records of individuals who have beneficial ownership, ensuring compliance with regulations aimed at preventing illicit activities.

#### Transaction Records

Transaction records document the buying and selling of securities and other financial instruments. Key components include:

- **Order Tickets**: These are written records of buy or sell orders placed by clients. They include details such as the security name, quantity, price, and order type. Order tickets are crucial for verifying the execution of client instructions.

- **Trade Confirmations**: After a transaction is executed, a trade confirmation is sent to the client, detailing the terms of the transaction, including the security, quantity, price, and any fees or commissions.

- **Settlement Records**: These records document the settlement of trades, ensuring that securities and funds are exchanged according to agreed terms. They are vital for reconciling accounts and ensuring the accuracy of financial records.

#### Communications with Clients

Effective communication with clients is a cornerstone of the financial services industry. Records of these communications include:

- **Correspondence**: This encompasses all written communications with clients, including emails, letters, and instant messages. Correspondence records are essential for demonstrating compliance with regulatory requirements and resolving disputes.

- **Marketing and Advertising Materials**: Any materials used to promote investment products or services must be retained. These records help ensure that communications are fair, balanced, and not misleading.

- **Customer Complaints**: Firms must maintain records of all customer complaints, along with the actions taken to resolve them. This is critical for regulatory compliance and improving customer service.

#### Financial and Operational Reports

Broker-dealers are required to maintain various financial and operational reports to demonstrate their financial health and operational integrity. These include:

- **Financial Statements**: Regularly prepared financial statements provide insight into the firm's financial condition, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.

- **Net Capital Computations**: Broker-dealers must maintain records of their net capital computations to ensure they meet minimum capital requirements set by regulators.

- **Operational Reports**: These reports include records of the firm's operations, such as compliance with trading rules, risk management practices, and internal controls.

### Specific Documents and Their Importance

The following documents are critical components of a firm's recordkeeping responsibilities:

- **Order Tickets**: As mentioned earlier, order tickets are essential for documenting client instructions. They must be accurate and complete to ensure that trades are executed according to the client's wishes.

- **Trade Confirmations**: These documents serve as a formal acknowledgment of a transaction, providing clients with the details they need to verify the accuracy of the trade.

- **Account Statements**: Regular account statements are vital for transparency and client trust. They provide a comprehensive overview of the client's financial position and activity.

- **Correspondence**: Maintaining records of all client communications is crucial for compliance and dispute resolution. These records must be easily accessible and organized.

### Accuracy and Completeness in Recordkeeping

Accuracy and completeness are paramount in recordkeeping. Inaccurate or incomplete records can lead to regulatory penalties, legal disputes, and loss of client trust. Firms must implement robust processes to ensure that records are accurate, up-to-date, and reflective of all client interactions and transactions.

#### Best Practices for Ensuring Accuracy

- **Regular Audits**: Conducting regular audits of records helps identify and rectify discrepancies, ensuring that records are accurate and complete.

- **Training and Education**: Providing ongoing training for staff on recordkeeping requirements and best practices helps maintain high standards of accuracy and compliance.

- **Technology Solutions**: Leveraging technology to automate recordkeeping processes can reduce errors and improve efficiency. Systems should be designed to capture and store data accurately and securely.

### Supervisory Procedures and Compliance

Supervisory procedures play a critical role in ensuring that records are maintained properly. Firms must establish and enforce policies and procedures to oversee the recordkeeping process and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

#### Key Elements of Effective Supervisory Procedures

- **Clear Policies**: Firms should have clear, written policies outlining recordkeeping requirements and procedures. These policies should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in regulations and industry practices.

- **Regular Reviews**: Supervisors should conduct regular reviews of records to ensure compliance with policies and identify any areas for improvement.

- **Accountability**: Assigning specific responsibilities for recordkeeping to individuals or teams helps ensure accountability and adherence to policies.

- **Compliance Monitoring**: Implementing systems to monitor compliance with recordkeeping requirements helps identify potential issues early and take corrective action.

### Regulatory References

The SEC and FINRA have established specific rules governing recordkeeping requirements for broker-dealers and RRs. Two key regulations are:

- **SEC Rule 17a-3**: This rule outlines the minimum requirements for records that broker-dealers must create and maintain.
