## 12.4.2 Annuity Units

Understanding annuity units is crucial for anyone preparing for the Series 6 Exam, as they play a central role in the payout phase of variable annuities. This section delves into the concept of annuity units, their calculation, and how they impact the income stream during retirement.

### Introduction to Annuity Units

When a variable annuity transitions from the accumulation phase to the payout phase, a process known as annuitization occurs. During this transition, the accumulation units, which represent the investor's share of the annuity during the accumulation phase, are converted into annuity units. This conversion marks the beginning of the payout phase, where the investor receives periodic payments.

**Annuity Units Defined:** Annuity units are fixed units that represent the contract owner's share of the separate account during the payout phase. Unlike accumulation units, which are focused on growth, annuity units are concerned with providing a steady income stream.

### The Process of Annuitization

Annuitization involves converting the accumulated value of a variable annuity into a series of periodic payments. This conversion is influenced by several factors, including the contract value at the time of annuitization, the annuitant's life expectancy, and the chosen payout option. 

**Key Steps in Annuitization:**

1. **Determine Contract Value:** The total value of the annuity at the time of annuitization is calculated based on the number of accumulation units and their current value.
   
2. **Select Payout Option:** The annuitant chooses a payout option, which can be life-only, joint and survivor, or period certain, among others. Each option affects the payment amount and frequency.

3. **Calculate Annuity Units:** The contract value is divided by the annuity unit value to determine the number of annuity units. This number remains constant throughout the payout phase.

4. **Establish Payment Amounts:** The payment amount is determined by multiplying the number of annuity units by the current annuity unit value. This value fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investments.

### Calculating Annuity Units

The calculation of annuity units is a critical step in determining the income stream from a variable annuity. The formula involves dividing the total contract value by the annuity unit value at the time of annuitization.

**Formula for Annuity Units:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Number of Annuity Units} = \frac{\text{Contract Value at Annuitization}}{\text{Annuity Unit Value}} {{< /katex >}}

**Example Calculation:**

Suppose an annuitant has a contract value of $200,000 at the time of annuitization. If the annuity unit value is $10, the number of annuity units would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Number of Annuity Units} = \frac{200,000}{10} = 20,000 {{< /katex >}}

This means the annuitant will receive payments based on 20,000 annuity units.

### Fluctuation of Annuity Unit Values

Annuity unit values are subject to fluctuation based on the performance of the underlying investments in the separate account. These investments can include stocks, bonds, or other securities, and their performance directly impacts the annuity unit value.

**Impact of Fluctuations:**

- **Positive Market Performance:** If the underlying investments perform well, the annuity unit value increases, leading to higher periodic payments.
- **Negative Market Performance:** Conversely, if the market performs poorly, the annuity unit value decreases, resulting in lower payments.

### Examples of Payment Variability

To illustrate how annuity unit values affect payments, consider an annuitant with 20,000 annuity units:

- **Scenario 1:** Annuity unit value increases to $12.
  - Payment = 20,000 units x $12 = $240,000 annually.

- **Scenario 2:** Annuity unit value decreases to $8.
  - Payment = 20,000 units x $8 = $160,000 annually.

These examples demonstrate the variable nature of income from a variable annuity, which is directly linked to market performance.

### Variable Income Stream During Retirement

Annuity units provide a variable income stream during retirement, offering the potential for growth in payments but also exposing the annuitant to market risks. This variability can be advantageous in inflationary environments, where increasing payments help maintain purchasing power.

**Advantages of Variable Income:**

- **Inflation Protection:** Payments can increase over time, helping to offset inflation.
- **Market Participation:** Annuitants benefit from positive market performance.

**Challenges of Variable Income:**

- **Market Risk:** Payments can decrease if the market underperforms.
- **Income Uncertainty:** Variable payments may not meet fixed expenses.

### Glossary

- **Annuity Units:** Units representing the contract owner's share of the separate account during the payout phase.
- **Annuitization:** The process of converting the variable annuity's accumulated value into a series of periodic payments.

- [ ] They are liquidated for cash.
- [ ] They are transferred to a new account.
- [ ] They remain unchanged.

> **Explanation:** During annuitization, accumulation units are converted into annuity units, marking the start of the payout phase.

### What do annuity units represent?

- [x] The contract owner's share of the separate account during the payout phase.
- [ ] The initial investment amount.
- [ ] The total number of accumulation units.
- [ ] The fixed interest rate of the annuity.

> **Explanation:** Annuity units represent the contract owner's share of the separate account during the payout phase, providing a basis for calculating periodic payments.

### How is the number of annuity units calculated?

- [x] By dividing the contract value by the annuity unit value.
- [ ] By multiplying the contract value by the annuity unit value.
- [ ] By adding the contract value to the annuity unit value.
- [ ] By subtracting the annuity unit value from the contract value.

> **Explanation:** The number of annuity units is calculated by dividing the contract value at annuitization by the annuity unit value.

### What causes annuity unit values to fluctuate?

- [x] The performance of the underlying investments.
- [ ] The annuitant's age.
- [ ] The initial investment amount.
- [ ] The selected payout option.

> **Explanation:** Annuity unit values fluctuate based on the performance of the underlying investments in the separate account.

### How does an increase in annuity unit value affect payments?

- [x] Payments increase.
- [ ] Payments decrease.
- [ ] Payments remain the same.
