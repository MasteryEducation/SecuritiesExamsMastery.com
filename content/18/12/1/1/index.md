## 12.1.1 Present Value and Future Value Calculations

Understanding the Time Value of Money (TVM) is crucial for anyone preparing for the Series 6 Exam, as it forms the foundation for many financial concepts and calculations. This section will guide you through the intricacies of Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV) calculations, providing you with the tools needed to excel in the securities industry.

### Understanding the Time Value of Money (TVM)

The Time Value of Money is a fundamental financial principle that suggests a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. This concept is based on the potential earning capacity of money, meaning that money available now can be invested to earn returns, thereby increasing its future value. This principle underpins many areas of finance, including investment valuation, interest rate calculations, and financial planning.

### Present Value (PV)

**Definition:** Present Value is the current worth of a future sum of money or cash flows given a specified rate of return. It answers the question: "How much is a future amount worth today?"

#### Present Value Formula

The formula to calculate Present Value is:

{{< katex >}} PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( PV \\) = Present Value
- \\( FV \\) = Future Value
- \\( r \\) = interest rate per period
- \\( n \\) = number of periods

#### Example: Calculating Present Value

Imagine you need $10,000 five years from now, and you expect an annual return of 5%. To find out how much you need to invest today, use the PV formula:

{{< katex >}} PV = \frac{10,000}{(1 + 0.05)^5} = \frac{10,000}{1.27628} \approx 7,835.26 {{< /katex >}}

Thus, you would need to invest approximately $7,835.26 today to have $10,000 in five years at a 5% annual return.

### Future Value (FV)

**Definition:** Future Value is the value of a current asset at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth. It answers the question: "How much will my investment be worth in the future?"

#### Future Value Formula

The formula to calculate Future Value is:

{{< katex >}} FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( FV \\) = Future Value
- \\( PV \\) = Present Value
- \\( r \\) = interest rate per period
- \\( n \\) = number of periods

#### Example: Calculating Future Value

Suppose you invest $5,000 today in an account that earns 6% annually. To find out how much it will be worth in 10 years, use the FV formula:

{{< katex >}} FV = 5,000 \times (1 + 0.06)^{10} = 5,000 \times 1.790847 \approx 8,954.24 {{< /katex >}}

Therefore, your $5,000 investment will grow to approximately $8,954.24 in 10 years at a 6% annual interest rate.

### Applications in Securities Valuation

Understanding PV and FV is essential for valuing various financial instruments such as bonds, annuities, and other investment products. Here's how these concepts apply:

#### Valuing Bonds

Bonds are valued based on the present value of their future cash flows, which include periodic interest payments and the principal repayment at maturity. The discount rate used is typically the bond's yield to maturity (YTM).

#### Valuing Annuities

Annuities involve a series of periodic payments, and their valuation requires calculating the present value of these future cash flows. The rate used is often the expected return on investment.

#### Other Financial Instruments

The concepts of PV and FV are also used in valuing stocks, determining the cost of capital, and assessing investment opportunities.

### Glossary

- **Time Value of Money (TVM):** The idea that money available now is more valuable than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.
- **Present Value (PV):** The current value of a future sum of money discounted at a specific interest rate.
- **Future Value (FV):** The value of an asset at a specific date in the future based on an assumed rate of growth over time.

- Finance textbooks and online courses can provide further insights into these calculations and their applications.

### Summary

The Time Value of Money is a cornerstone of financial theory, and mastering the calculations for Present Value and Future Value is essential for success in the Series 6 Exam. By understanding these concepts, you can effectively evaluate investment opportunities and make informed financial decisions.

## Series 6 Exam Practice Questions: Present Value and Future Value Calculations

{{< quizdown >}}

### What is the Present Value of $15,000 received in 8 years with an annual discount rate of 4%?

- [ ] $11,000
- [x] $10,267.92
- [ ] $12,500
- [ ] $14,000

> **Explanation:** Using the formula \( PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \), we have \( PV = \frac{15,000}{(1 + 0.04)^8} = \frac{15,000}{1.3686} \approx 10,267.92 \).

### If you invest $3,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, what will be its Future Value in 7 years?

- [ ] $4,000
- [ ] $3,500
- [x] $4,230.56
- [ ] $5,000

> **Explanation:** Using the formula \( FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \), we have \( FV = 3,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^7 = 3,000 \times 1.4071 \approx 4,230.56 \).

### How does the Time Value of Money principle affect investment decisions?

- [x] It emphasizes investing early to maximize returns.
- [ ] It suggests saving money in a safe at home.
- [ ] It discourages taking any investment risks.
- [ ] It has no impact on investment strategies.

> **Explanation:** The Time Value of Money principle highlights the importance of investing early to take advantage of compounding returns over time.

### What is the Future Value of $1,200 invested for 3 years at an annual interest rate of 6%?

- [ ] $1,300
- [ ] $1,500
- [x] $1,428.48
- [ ] $1,600

> **Explanation:** Using the formula \( FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \), we have \( FV = 1,200 \times (1 + 0.06)^3 = 1,200 \times 1.191016 \approx 1,428.48 \).

### Calculate the Present Value of $5,000 to be received in 10 years with a discount rate of 7%.
