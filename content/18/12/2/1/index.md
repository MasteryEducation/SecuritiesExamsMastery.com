## 12.2.1 Current Yield

Understanding the concept of current yield is crucial for anyone involved in bond investments, whether you're preparing for the Series 6 Exam or managing a portfolio. Current yield provides investors with a snapshot of the income-generating capability of a bond relative to its market price. This section will delve into the definition, calculation, and application of current yield, offering practical examples and insights into its role in bond valuation.

### Definition of Current Yield

**Current Yield** is a financial metric used to evaluate the income return on a bond relative to its current market price. It is expressed as a percentage and represents the bond's annual interest payment divided by its current market price. Unlike other yield measures, the current yield does not consider the bond's maturity date or any potential capital gains or losses that may occur if the bond is held to maturity.

### Formula for Current Yield

The formula for calculating the current yield of a bond is straightforward:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}}
{{< /katex >}}

- **Annual Coupon Payment**: This is the total interest paid by the bond issuer to the bondholder over a year. It is determined by the bond's coupon rate and its face value.
- **Current Market Price**: This is the price at which the bond is currently trading in the market.

### Example Calculations of Current Yield

To illustrate the application of the current yield formula, let's consider three scenarios where a bond is selling at par, at a premium, and at a discount.

#### Example 1: Bond Selling at Par

Assume a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and it is currently trading at par ($1,000).

- **Annual Coupon Payment**: 5% of $1,000 = $50
- **Current Market Price**: $1,000

Using the formula:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\$50}{\$1,000} = 5\%
{{< /katex >}}

In this case, the current yield equals the coupon rate because the bond is selling at par.

#### Example 2: Bond Selling at a Premium

Consider a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, but it is currently trading at a premium of $1,100.

- **Annual Coupon Payment**: 5% of $1,000 = $50
- **Current Market Price**: $1,100

Using the formula:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\$50}{\$1,100} \approx 4.55\%
{{< /katex >}}

Here, the current yield is lower than the coupon rate because the bond is selling at a premium.

#### Example 3: Bond Selling at a Discount

Now, consider a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, but it is currently trading at a discount of $900.

- **Annual Coupon Payment**: 5% of $1,000 = $50
- **Current Market Price**: $900

Using the formula:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\$50}{\$900} \approx 5.56\%
{{< /katex >}}

In this scenario, the current yield is higher than the coupon rate because the bond is selling at a discount.

### Difference Between Current Yield and Yield to Maturity

While the current yield is a useful measure of a bond's income-generating ability, it is important to distinguish it from **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**. YTM is a more comprehensive measure that considers the total expected return of a bond if held until maturity, including all coupon payments and any capital gain or loss that results from the difference between the purchase price and the face value.

- **Current Yield**: Focuses solely on the income aspect, ignoring the time value of money and any capital gains or losses.
- **Yield to Maturity**: Accounts for the entire life of the bond, incorporating the time value of money and the bond's price changes over time.

### Usefulness of Current Yield

Current yield is particularly useful for investors who are primarily interested in the income aspect of a bond. It provides a quick and easy way to compare the income potential of different bonds, especially when evaluating bonds with similar maturities but different coupon rates and market prices. However, it should not be the sole criterion for investment decisions, as it does not provide a complete picture of the bond's total return potential.

### Practical Applications and Considerations

- **Income-Focused Investors**: Current yield is a key metric for investors seeking regular income from their bond investments. It helps in selecting bonds that offer the best income relative to their market price.
- **Market Conditions**: In a rising interest rate environment, bond prices typically fall, which can increase the current yield for new investors. Conversely, falling interest rates can lead to higher bond prices and lower current yields.
- **Bond Comparisons**: When comparing bonds, look at both current yield and YTM to get a balanced view of income potential and total return.

### Glossary

- **Current Yield**: The annual income (interest or dividends) divided by the current price of the security.
- **Coupon Payment**: The periodic interest payment made to bondholders during the life of the bond.

## Series 6 Exam Practice Questions: Current Yield

{{< quizdown >}}

### What is the formula for calculating the current yield of a bond?

- [x] \(\frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}}\)
- [ ] \(\frac{\text{Current Market Price}}{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}\)
- [ ] \(\frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Face Value}}\)
- [ ] \(\frac{\text{Face Value}}{\text{Current Market Price}}\)

> **Explanation:** The current yield is calculated by dividing the bond's annual coupon payment by its current market price, which provides a measure of the bond's income return relative to its price.

### How does the current yield of a bond selling at a premium compare to its coupon rate?

- [ ] It is higher than the coupon rate.
- [x] It is lower than the coupon rate.
- [ ] It is equal to the coupon rate.
- [ ] It is unrelated to the coupon rate.

> **Explanation:** When a bond sells at a premium, its current yield is lower than the coupon rate because the market price is higher than the face value, reducing the yield percentage.

### If a bond's current yield is higher than its coupon rate, what does this indicate about the bond's market price?

- [x] The bond is selling at a discount.
- [ ] The bond is selling at a premium.
- [ ] The bond is selling at par.
- [ ] The bond's market price is irrelevant to current yield.

> **Explanation:** A current yield higher than the coupon rate indicates that the bond is selling at a discount, meaning the market price is below the face value.

### Which of the following statements about current yield is true?

- [ ] It accounts for the time value of money.
- [ ] It includes capital gains or losses.
- [x] It focuses solely on the income aspect.
- [ ] It is the same as yield to maturity.

> **Explanation:** Current yield focuses solely on the income aspect of a bond, ignoring the time value of money and potential capital gains or losses, which are considered in yield to maturity.

### Why might an investor use current yield when evaluating bonds?

- [ ] To determine the bond's total return.
- [x] To assess the bond's income-generating ability.
- [ ] To calculate the bond's maturity value.

> **Explanation:** Investors use current yield to assess a bond's income-generating ability relative to its price, providing a quick comparison of income potential across different bonds.

### What happens to the current yield if the market price of a bond increases?

- [ ] Current yield increases.
- [x] Current yield decreases.
- [ ] Current yield remains unchanged.
- [ ] Current yield becomes negative.

> **Explanation:** If the market price of a bond increases, the current yield decreases because the denominator in the current yield formula (current market price) increases, reducing the overall yield percentage.

### Which yield measure provides a more comprehensive view of a bond's total expected return?

- [ ] Current yield
- [x] Yield to maturity
- [ ] Coupon yield
- [ ] Discount yield

> **Explanation:** Yield to maturity provides a more comprehensive view of a bond's total expected return, incorporating the time value of money and potential capital gains or losses over the bond's life.

### In what scenario would a bond's current yield be equal to its coupon rate?

- [x] When the bond is selling at par.
- [ ] When the bond is selling at a premium.
- [ ] When the bond is selling at a discount.
- [ ] When the bond is callable.

> **Explanation:** A bond's current yield is equal to its coupon rate when it is selling at par, meaning the market price equals the face value.

### How does the current yield help investors during a rising interest rate environment?

- [x] It allows investors to find bonds with higher income potential.
- [ ] It predicts future bond prices.
- [ ] It guarantees a fixed return.
