## 4.2.5.3 Class C Shares

### Introduction to Class C Shares

Class C shares are a type of mutual fund share class that are characterized by their level loads and relatively high annual expenses. Unlike Class A shares, which typically have front-end loads, or Class B shares, which often have back-end loads that decrease over time, Class C shares charge an ongoing annual fee. This makes them particularly appealing to investors seeking short- to medium-term investment horizons.

### Characteristics of Class C Shares

#### Level Loads and High Annual Expenses

The defining feature of Class C shares is their level load structure. This means that instead of paying a one-time sales charge when purchasing or redeeming shares, investors incur an annual asset-based fee. This fee is generally higher than the ongoing fees associated with Class A shares and can significantly impact the overall cost of holding the investment over time.

- **Annual Fees:** Class C shares typically charge an annual fee of around 1% of the fund’s assets. This fee is deducted from the fund’s assets, reducing the return for investors.
- **No Front-End Loads:** Investors do not pay an initial sales charge when purchasing Class C shares, allowing for the full amount of their investment to be put to work immediately.
- **Minimal Back-End Loads:** While Class C shares may have a small back-end load if sold within the first year, this is generally much lower than the contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC) associated with Class B shares.

#### Suitability for Short- to Medium-Term Investors

Class C shares are often recommended for investors with a short- to medium-term investment horizon. The absence of front-end loads allows for immediate full investment of capital, while the lack of significant back-end loads provides flexibility if the investor decides to sell the shares within a few years.

- **Short-Term Flexibility:** Investors who anticipate needing access to their funds within a few years may find Class C shares advantageous due to the minimal exit costs.
- **Medium-Term Consideration:** For investors planning to hold their investment for a medium-term period (typically 3-5 years), the ongoing annual fees may be justified by the flexibility and lack of front-end charges.

#### Continuous High Expenses

One of the drawbacks of Class C shares is the ongoing high expense ratio. Unlike Class B shares, which may convert to Class A shares after a certain period (thereby reducing the annual fees), Class C shares do not convert. This means that investors will continue to incur high annual expenses for as long as they hold the shares.

- **No Conversion to Class A:** The perpetual high expense ratio of Class C shares can erode returns over the long term, making them less suitable for long-term investors.
- **Impact on Returns:** Investors should carefully consider the impact of these ongoing expenses on their overall investment returns, especially if they plan to hold the investment for an extended period.

### Comparing Class C Shares to Other Share Classes

To fully understand the implications of choosing Class C shares, it is helpful to compare them to other mutual fund share classes, such as Class A and Class B shares.

#### Class A Shares

- **Front-End Loads:** Class A shares typically involve an upfront sales charge, which can reduce the initial amount invested.
- **Lower Ongoing Fees:** Once the front-end load is paid, Class A shares generally have lower annual expenses compared to Class C shares.
- **Long-Term Suitability:** Due to lower ongoing expenses, Class A shares may be more cost-effective for long-term investors.

#### Class B Shares

- **Back-End Loads:** Class B shares often have a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) that decreases over time.
- **Conversion to Class A:** After a certain period, Class B shares may convert to Class A shares, reducing annual expenses.
- **Medium- to Long-Term Suitability:** Class B shares are often suitable for investors who plan to hold their investment long enough to benefit from the conversion to Class A shares.

### Cost Implications of Class C Shares

When considering Class C shares, it is crucial to evaluate the total costs over the investment horizon. The ongoing annual fees can significantly impact the net return on investment, particularly if the shares are held for an extended period.

#### Evaluating Total Costs

Investors should perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the flexibility and lack of front-end charges justify the higher ongoing expenses.

- **Short-Term Costs:** For short-term investments, the absence of front-end loads can be beneficial, but the annual fees will still impact returns.
- **Medium-Term Costs:** For medium-term investments, the cumulative effect of the annual fees should be weighed against the flexibility benefits.
- **Long-Term Costs:** For long-term investments, the high annual expenses can substantially erode returns, making Class C shares less attractive.

#### Practical Example

Consider an investor who plans to invest $10,000 in a mutual fund. If they choose Class C shares with a 1% annual fee, the cost over five years would be approximately $500, assuming no change in the fund's value. In contrast, a similar investment in Class A shares might incur a front-end load of 5% ($500) but have lower ongoing fees, potentially resulting in a higher net return over the same period.

### Regulatory Considerations and Compliance

When dealing with Class C shares, it is important to understand the regulatory framework governing mutual funds. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) provides guidelines on mutual fund share classes, emphasizing the need for transparency and suitability in sales practices.

#### FINRA Guidelines

- **Disclosure Requirements:** Financial advisors must disclose all fees and expenses associated with Class C shares to ensure that investors are fully informed.
- **Suitability Obligations:** Advisors must assess the suitability of Class C shares for each investor, considering their investment goals and time horizon.

#### Compliance Best Practices

- **Comparative Analysis:** Advisors should provide a comparative analysis of different share classes to help investors make informed decisions.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of the investment's performance and expenses can help ensure that the chosen share class remains suitable for the investor's needs.

### Conclusion

Class C shares offer a unique combination of flexibility and ongoing costs, making them suitable for certain investment strategies. While they provide benefits for short- to medium-term investors, the perpetual high expenses can be detrimental to long-term returns. Investors and advisors must carefully evaluate the total cost implications and suitability of Class C shares within the broader context of their investment objectives and regulatory requirements.
