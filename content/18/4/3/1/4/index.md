## 4.3.1.4 Expenses and Fees

Variable annuities are complex financial products that combine investment and insurance features. Understanding the expenses and fees associated with these products is crucial for both financial professionals and investors. This section will delve into the various charges that can affect the performance and value of a variable annuity, providing you with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions and offer sound advice to clients.

### Common Fees Associated with Variable Annuities

Variable annuities come with a variety of fees that can significantly impact the net returns on investment. These fees compensate the insurance company for the risks they assume and the services they provide. Here, we will explore the most common fees associated with variable annuities:

#### Mortality and Expense Risk Charge

The Mortality and Expense (M&E) Risk Charge is a fundamental fee in variable annuities. It compensates the insurance company for the insurance risks it assumes, including the guarantee of lifetime income and death benefits. Additionally, this charge covers administrative expenses related to the annuity contract. Typically, the M&E charge ranges from 0.5% to 1.5% of the account value annually.

- **Purpose:** The M&E charge provides a safety net for the insurer against the risk of the annuitant living longer than expected, which would result in the insurer paying out more in benefits than initially anticipated. It also covers the cost of administrative tasks such as record-keeping and customer service.
  
- **Impact on Returns:** This charge reduces the overall return on the annuity investment. Over time, the cumulative effect of this fee can be substantial, especially if the annuity is held for a long period.

#### Investment Management Fees

Investment Management Fees are charged for the professional management of the investment options within the annuity. These fees are similar to the expense ratios of mutual funds and are deducted from the investment returns.

- **Structure:** Investment management fees vary depending on the investment options chosen by the annuity holder. They typically range from 0.5% to 2% annually.

- **Considerations:** It is essential to evaluate these fees in the context of the performance of the investment options. Higher fees do not necessarily correlate with better performance, so comparing the net returns after fees is crucial.

#### Administrative Fees

Administrative Fees are charged to cover the costs associated with maintaining the annuity contract. These fees can be charged as a flat annual fee or as a percentage of the account value.

- **Typical Costs:** Administrative fees can range from $25 to $100 annually, or a percentage of the account value, often around 0.15%.

- **Purpose:** These fees cover the costs of issuing statements, processing transactions, and providing customer support.

#### Surrender Charges

Surrender Charges are fees imposed when an annuity holder withdraws funds from the annuity before a specified period, usually the surrender period, has elapsed. These charges are designed to discourage early withdrawals and to allow the insurance company to recover the costs of issuing the annuity.

- **Structure:** Surrender charges are typically a percentage of the amount withdrawn and decrease over time, often starting at 7% or more and gradually reducing to 0% over a period of 6 to 8 years.

- **Impact on Liquidity:** The presence of surrender charges can significantly impact the liquidity of the investment, making it costly for investors to access their funds early.

#### Rider Fees

Rider Fees are additional charges for optional benefits or features that can be added to a variable annuity contract. These riders can provide enhanced benefits such as guaranteed minimum income, long-term care coverage, or enhanced death benefits.

- **Types of Riders:** Common riders include Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits (GLWB), Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIB), and Enhanced Death Benefits.

- **Cost:** The cost of riders varies depending on the type and level of benefits provided, typically ranging from 0.25% to 1% of the account value annually.

### Impact of Fees on Investment Returns

The fees associated with variable annuities can have a significant impact on the net returns of the investment. It is crucial for investors and financial professionals to understand how these fees affect the overall performance of the annuity:

- **Reduced Returns:** Each fee reduces the total return on the investment. Over time, the compounding effect of these fees can lead to a substantial reduction in the value of the annuity.

- **Importance of Full Disclosure:** It is essential to provide clients with a clear and comprehensive breakdown of all fees associated with the annuity. Full disclosure helps clients understand the true cost of the investment and make informed decisions.

- **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing the fee structures of different annuity contracts is vital. Even small differences in fees can lead to significant variations in returns over the long term.

### Importance of Comparing Annuity Contracts

When evaluating variable annuities, it is important to compare different contracts to identify competitive fee structures and features that align with the client's financial goals and risk tolerance:

- **Fee Comparison:** Analyze the total cost of ownership by comparing the M&E charges, investment management fees, administrative fees, and any additional rider fees across different annuity contracts.

- **Performance and Features:** Consider the historical performance of the investment options and the additional features or riders offered by the annuity. Ensure that the benefits justify the costs.

- **Client Suitability:** Ensure that the annuity aligns with the client's financial objectives, time horizon, and risk tolerance. A thorough suitability analysis helps in selecting the most appropriate product for the client.

### Glossary

- **Mortality and Expense Risk Charge:** A fee covering insurance risks and administrative expenses associated with a variable annuity.
