## 4.3.3.1 Disclosure Requirements

In the world of securities, particularly when dealing with variable contracts such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, disclosure requirements are paramount. These requirements ensure that clients are fully informed about the products they are investing in, including the associated risks and costs. This section will delve into the necessity of full and fair disclosure, the delivery of prospectuses, the disclosure of fees and expenses, risks, surrender charges, potential tax penalties, and the responsibility to ensure client understanding.

### The Importance of Full and Fair Disclosure

Full and fair disclosure is a cornerstone of ethical sales practices in the securities industry. It involves providing clients with all necessary information to make informed investment decisions. This transparency builds trust and helps clients understand the potential benefits and risks associated with variable contracts.

#### Key Aspects of Full and Fair Disclosure

- **Transparency:** Clients should receive clear and comprehensive information about the variable contract, including how it works, its benefits, and its limitations.
- **Relevance:** Information provided must be relevant to the client's investment goals and financial situation.
- **Comprehensiveness:** All material facts, including potential risks and costs, must be disclosed.
- **Timeliness:** Information should be provided in a timely manner, allowing clients to make informed decisions before committing to the investment.

### Required Delivery of Prospectuses

A prospectus is a legal document that provides detailed information about an investment offering. For variable contracts, delivering a prospectus is not just a best practice; it is a regulatory requirement. The prospectus serves as a comprehensive guide for potential investors, detailing the contract's features, investment options, and associated risks.

#### What the Prospectus Must Include

1. **Investment Objectives and Options:** Detailed descriptions of the investment options available within the variable contract.
2. **Fees and Expenses:** A breakdown of all fees and expenses associated with the contract, including administrative fees, fund expenses, and any other charges.
3. **Risks:** A thorough discussion of the risks involved with the investment, including market risk, interest rate risk, and any specific risks related to the underlying investments.
4. **Performance Information:** Historical performance data of the investment options, if available.
5. **Surrender Charges and Withdrawal Penalties:** Information on any charges or penalties for early withdrawal or surrender of the contract.

#### Timing and Method of Delivery

The prospectus must be delivered to the client before or at the time of sale. This ensures that the client has all the necessary information to make an informed decision. Delivery can be done physically or electronically, provided that the client consents to electronic delivery and has the means to access the document.

### Disclosure of Fees, Expenses, and Surrender Charges

Understanding the costs associated with variable contracts is crucial for clients. These costs can significantly impact the overall return on investment, making it essential for financial professionals to disclose all fees and expenses clearly.

#### Types of Fees and Expenses

- **Administrative Fees:** Ongoing fees to cover the cost of managing the contract.
- **Mortality and Expense Risk Charges:** Fees to cover the insurance component of the contract.
- **Fund Expenses:** Fees associated with the management of the underlying investment funds.
- **Surrender Charges:** Fees for early withdrawal or surrender of the contract, typically decreasing over time.

#### Importance of Fee Disclosure

By disclosing all fees and expenses, financial professionals help clients understand the true cost of the investment. This transparency allows clients to compare different products and make informed decisions based on their financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Disclosure of Risks

Variable contracts come with inherent risks, and it is the responsibility of the financial professional to ensure that clients understand these risks before investing. This includes both general market risks and specific risks associated with the investment options within the contract.

#### Common Risks in Variable Contracts

- **Market Risk:** The risk that the value of the investment will fluctuate due to changes in the market.
- **Interest Rate Risk:** The risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the investment.
- **Credit Risk:** The risk that the issuer of a security may default on its obligations.
- **Liquidity Risk:** The risk that the investment cannot be easily converted into cash without a significant loss in value.

### Disclosure of Potential Tax Penalties

Variable contracts can have significant tax implications, especially if withdrawals are made before the age of 59½. It is crucial to disclose these potential penalties to clients to avoid unexpected tax liabilities.

#### Tax Considerations for Variable Contracts

- **Ordinary Income Tax:** Withdrawals from variable contracts are typically taxed as ordinary income.
- **Early Withdrawal Penalties:** Withdrawals made before the age of 59½ may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Earnings within the contract grow tax-deferred, meaning taxes are not paid until withdrawals are made.

### Ensuring Client Understanding

Ensuring that clients fully understand the product, its features, and associated risks is a critical component of the disclosure process. This involves not only providing the necessary information but also verifying that the client comprehends the information.

#### Strategies for Ensuring Client Understanding

- **Clear Communication:** Use simple, straightforward language to explain complex concepts.
- **Interactive Tools:** Utilize charts, graphs, and other visual aids to illustrate key points.
- **Client Education:** Offer educational resources and opportunities for clients to ask questions.
- **Confirmation of Understanding:** Ask clients to summarize their understanding of the product and its risks to ensure comprehension.
