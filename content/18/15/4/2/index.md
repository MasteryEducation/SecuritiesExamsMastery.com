#### Create a Concise Review Sheet

1. **Summarize Key Concepts**: Develop a one-page summary of essential formulas, regulations, and concepts. This sheet serves as a quick reference for last-minute review.

2. **Highlight Frequently Tested Areas**: Use bold or colored text to emphasize critical points, such as the definition of investment companies and suitability obligations.

3. **Include Mnemonics and Acronyms**: Incorporate memory aids to help recall complex information. For example, use "DRIP" to remember Dividend Reinvestment Plans.

### Mental Preparation and Rest

2. **Schedule Breaks**: Incorporate regular breaks into your study sessions to prevent fatigue. Short breaks can improve focus and productivity.

3. **Avoid Cramming**: Resist the temptation to cram information at the last minute. Instead, engage in light review sessions to reinforce your knowledge.

#### Relaxation Techniques

1. **Practice Deep Breathing**: Use deep breathing exercises to calm nerves and reduce anxiety. Inhale slowly, hold your breath for a few seconds, and exhale gently.

2. **Visualization**: Visualize yourself successfully completing the exam. This positive imagery can boost confidence and alleviate stress.

### Additional Study Tips

2. **Use Flashcards**: Utilize flashcards for quick review of important terms and definitions. This method is effective for visual learners.

3. **Simulate Exam Conditions**: Take a practice exam under timed conditions to simulate the real test environment. This practice can help reduce anxiety and improve time management.
