### Sample Question 1: Mutual Fund Pricing

**Question:** What is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a mutual fund if its total assets are $10 million, total liabilities are $500,000, and there are 1 million shares outstanding?

- [ ] $9.50
- [ ] $9.75
- [x] $9.50
- [ ] $10.00

**Explanation:**

To calculate the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a mutual fund, use the formula:

{{< katex >}} \text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} {{< /katex >}}

Substitute the given values into the formula:

{{< katex >}} \text{NAV} = \frac{10,000,000 - 500,000}{1,000,000} = \frac{9,500,000}{1,000,000} = 9.50 {{< /katex >}}

Therefore, the correct answer is $9.50. This calculation reflects the value per share of the mutual fund, which is crucial for investors to understand the worth of their investment.

### Sample Question 2: Variable Annuities

**Question:** Which of the following best describes the accumulation phase of a variable annuity?

- [ ] The phase where the annuitant receives periodic payments.
- [ ] The phase where the annuity is converted into a fixed annuity.
- [x] The phase where contributions are made and investment grows tax-deferred.
- [ ] The phase where the annuitant selects a payout option.

**Explanation:**

The accumulation phase of a variable annuity is the period during which the investor makes contributions to the annuity, and the investment grows on a tax-deferred basis. This phase is critical as it determines the amount available for the annuitization phase, where the annuitant begins to receive payments.

- **Incorrect Options:**
  - The first option describes the annuitization phase, not the accumulation phase.
  - The second option refers to converting a variable annuity into a fixed annuity, which is not a standard phase.
