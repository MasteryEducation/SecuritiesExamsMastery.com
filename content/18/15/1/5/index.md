## 15.1.5 Client Account Management

Client account management is a critical component of the Series 6 Exam, focusing on the processes and regulations involved in opening, maintaining, and managing client accounts. This section will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the types of accounts, required documentation, customer identification procedures, suitability assessments, and regulatory compliance, all of which are essential for passing the Series 6 Exam and succeeding in the securities industry.

### Types of Client Accounts

Understanding the various types of client accounts is fundamental to managing them effectively. Each account type serves different purposes and comes with specific regulatory and documentation requirements.

#### Individual Accounts

Individual accounts are owned by one person who has complete control over the account. These accounts are straightforward but require the collection of specific personal information, such as the account holder's name, address, Social Security number, and employment details.

#### Joint Accounts

Joint accounts are owned by two or more individuals. There are two primary types:

- **Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS):** In this arrangement, if one account holder dies, the surviving owner(s) automatically inherit the entire account.
- **Tenants in Common (TIC):** Each owner has a specified percentage of the account, and upon death, their share is passed to their estate.

#### Custodial Accounts

Custodial accounts are managed by an adult for the benefit of a minor. They fall under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA). These accounts require specific documentation, such as the minor's Social Security number and the custodian's information.

#### Corporate and Partnership Accounts

Corporate and partnership accounts require documentation proving the entity's legal status, such as articles of incorporation or a partnership agreement. A resolution authorizing specific individuals to act on behalf of the entity is also necessary.

#### Trust Accounts

Trust accounts are established by a trust agreement and require documentation such as the trust document and information about the trustee(s) and beneficiaries.

### Account Opening Procedures

Opening a client account involves several steps to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to protect both the client and the firm.

#### New Account Form Requirements

The new account form collects essential information about the client, including:

- Personal information (name, address, Social Security number)
- Employment details
- Financial situation (income, net worth)
- Investment objectives and risk tolerance

#### Customer Identification Program (CIP)

Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions must implement a Customer Identification Program (CIP) to verify the identity of individuals opening accounts. This involves:

- Collecting identifying information (name, date of birth, address, identification number)
- Verifying the information through documents (e.g., driver's license, passport) or non-documentary methods
- Maintaining records of the information used for verification

#### Beneficial Ownership and Control Persons

For legal entity accounts, firms must identify beneficial owners and control persons. Beneficial owners are individuals who own 25% or more of the entity, while control persons are those with significant responsibility to control, manage, or direct the entity.

### Suitability and Investment Recommendations

Assessing suitability is a core responsibility of registered representatives, ensuring that investment recommendations align with the client's financial situation and objectives.

#### Gathering Client Information

To make suitable recommendations, representatives must gather and analyze comprehensive client information, including:

- Financial status (income, expenses, assets, liabilities)
- Investment experience and knowledge
- Risk tolerance and investment goals

#### Assessing Financial Objectives and Risk Tolerance

Understanding a client's financial objectives (e.g., income, growth, preservation of capital) and risk tolerance is crucial for making appropriate investment recommendations. This involves discussing potential risks and returns and ensuring the client understands the implications of their investment choices.

#### Making Suitable Recommendations

Based on the gathered information, representatives should recommend investment products that align with the client's objectives and risk profile. This may involve explaining different investment options and their associated risks and benefits.

### Account Maintenance

Maintaining client accounts involves ongoing management to ensure accuracy, compliance, and responsiveness to client needs.

#### Updating Client Information

Regularly updating client information is essential for maintaining accurate records and ensuring that investment recommendations remain suitable. This includes changes in employment, income, or financial goals.

#### Address Changes and Statements

Clients must notify the firm of any address changes to ensure timely delivery of account statements and other communications. Firms are required to send statements at least quarterly, detailing account activity and holdings.

#### Power of Attorney and Third-Party Authorizations

Clients may authorize third parties to act on their behalf through a power of attorney. This requires specific documentation and must be carefully managed to prevent unauthorized access or fraud.

### Privacy and Confidentiality

Protecting client information is a legal and ethical obligation for financial institutions.

#### Regulation S-P Compliance

Regulation S-P requires firms to implement policies and procedures to protect the privacy of consumer financial information. This includes:

- Providing initial and annual privacy notices to clients
- Offering clients the opportunity to opt-out of information sharing with non-affiliated third parties

#### Safeguarding Customer Information

Firms must establish robust security measures to safeguard customer information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This involves implementing technical, physical, and administrative safeguards.

### Recordkeeping and Communication Standards

Effective recordkeeping and communication are vital for compliance and client satisfaction.

#### Recordkeeping Requirements

FINRA and SEC regulations mandate that firms maintain accurate records of client accounts, transactions, and communications. These records must be retained for specific periods and be readily accessible for regulatory review.

#### Communication Standards

All communications with clients must be fair, balanced, and not misleading. This includes advertising, sales literature, and correspondence. Firms must ensure that communications comply with FINRA's content standards and are approved by a principal when required.

### Practical Applications and Case Studies

To apply your knowledge of client account management, consider the following scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** A client wants to open a joint account with their spouse. What documentation is required, and what considerations should you discuss with the client regarding account ownership and survivorship?
- **Scenario 2:** A corporate client needs to open an account for investment purposes. What steps must you take to verify the entity's legal status and identify authorized individuals?
- **Scenario 3:** A client expresses interest in a high-risk investment product. How would you assess their suitability for this investment, and what disclosures are necessary?

### Exam Preparation and Practice

To prepare for the Series 6 Exam, practice completing sample account forms and apply your knowledge to client case studies. Review regulatory requirements for account management to ensure compliance and deepen your understanding of the material.
