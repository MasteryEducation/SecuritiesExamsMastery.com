Let's explore some scenarios where the MSRB and EMMA play a crucial role in the municipal securities market:

#### Scenario 1: Analyzing a New Municipal Bond Issue

A financial advisor is considering recommending a new municipal bond to a client.

This proactive approach helps the client maintain compliance and avoid potential penalties.

A compliance officer at a brokerage firm is tasked with educating the firm's staff about recent changes to MSRB rules. The officer uses the MSRB's educational resources, including webinars and guides, to develop a training program for the team. This program ensures that all staff members understand the new rules and how they impact the firm's operations.
