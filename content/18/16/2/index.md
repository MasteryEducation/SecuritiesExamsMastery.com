## 16.2 Important Formulas and Calculations

### Introduction

Mastering financial formulas is crucial for success on the Series 6 Exam. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the essential formulas you need to know, including their applications and intricacies. Understanding these formulas will not only help you pass the exam but also equip you with the analytical skills necessary for a successful career in the securities industry.

### 1. Net Asset Value (NAV)

#### Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Number of Outstanding Shares}} {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the per-share value of a mutual fund. It is calculated by subtracting the fund's liabilities from its total assets and then dividing the result by the number of outstanding shares. NAV is typically calculated at the end of each trading day.

#### Example

Suppose a mutual fund has total assets of $100 million and total liabilities of $5 million, with 10 million shares outstanding. The NAV would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{NAV} = \frac{100,000,000 - 5,000,000}{10,000,000} = \frac{95,000,000}{10,000,000} = 9.50 {{< /katex >}}

### 2. Current Yield

#### Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Interest Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}} {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

Current yield is a measure of the income provided by a bond as a percentage of its current market price. It is useful for investors looking to understand the income-generating potential of a bond relative to its price.

#### Example

Consider a bond with an annual interest payment of $50 and a current market price of $1,000. The current yield would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Yield} = \frac{50}{1,000} = 0.05 \text{ or } 5\% {{< /katex >}}

### 3. Yield to Maturity (YTM)

#### Formula

The Yield to Maturity (YTM) is a complex calculation that requires solving for the interest rate in the present value equation of bond cash flows. The formula is:

{{< katex >}} P = \frac{C}{(1 + YTM)^1} + \frac{C}{(1 + YTM)^2} + \ldots + \frac{C + F}{(1 + YTM)^n} {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( P \\) = Current price of the bond
- \\( C \\) = Annual coupon payment
- \\( F \\) = Face value of the bond
- \\( n \\) = Number of years to maturity

#### Explanation

YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures. It accounts for all coupon payments and the difference between the purchase price and the face value.

#### Example

For a bond with a face value of $1,000, a current price of $950, an annual coupon payment of $60, and 5 years to maturity, solving the YTM involves trial and error or a financial calculator.

### 4. Time Value of Money (TVM)

#### Present Value (PV) Formula

{{< katex >}} PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( FV \\) = Future Value
- \\( r \\) = Interest rate per period
- \\( n \\) = Number of periods

#### Future Value (FV) Formula

{{< katex >}} FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

The Time Value of Money (TVM) concept states that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future due to its earning potential. Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV) calculations are fundamental for understanding investment opportunities.

#### Example

If you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years, the future value would be:

{{< katex >}} FV = 1,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 = 1,000 \times 1.157625 = 1,157.63 {{< /katex >}}

### 5. Mutual Fund Pricing

#### Public Offering Price (POP) Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{POP} = \frac{\text{NAV}}{1 - \text{Sales Charge Percentage}} {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

The Public Offering Price (POP) is the price at which new mutual fund shares are sold to investors, including any sales charge (load).

#### Example

If a mutual fund has an NAV of $10 and a sales charge of 5%, the POP would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{POP} = \frac{10}{1 - 0.05} = \frac{10}{0.95} = 10.53 {{< /katex >}}

### 6. Breakpoints and Discounts

#### Rights of Accumulation Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{Cumulative Investment} = \text{Current Investment} + \text{Previous Investments} {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

Rights of Accumulation allow investors to receive reduced sales charges based on the total amount invested in a mutual fund over time.

#### Example

If an investor has previously invested $20,000 and is now investing an additional $5,000, their cumulative investment would be $25,000, potentially qualifying them for a lower sales charge.

### 7. Taxation of Investment Products

#### Capital Gains Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{Capital Gain} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Purchase Price} {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

Capital gains are the profits realized from the sale of securities or investments. Understanding how to calculate capital gains is essential for tax reporting.

#### Example

If an investor buys a stock for $100 and sells it for $150, the capital gain would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Capital Gain} = 150 - 100 = 50 {{< /katex >}}

### 8. Cost Basis Methods

#### Average Cost Method Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\text{Total Cost of Shares}}{\text{Total Number of Shares}} {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

The average cost method is used to calculate the cost basis of shares sold, particularly for mutual funds.

#### Example

If an investor buys 100 shares at $10 each and 50 shares at $15 each, the average cost would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Average Cost} = \frac{(100 \times 10) + (50 \times 15)}{150} = \frac{1,000 + 750}{150} = 11.67 {{< /katex >}}

### 9. Annuity Calculations

#### Accumulation Units Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{Accumulation Units} = \frac{\text{Investment Amount}}{\text{Unit Value}} {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

Accumulation units represent an investor's share of ownership in the separate account of a variable annuity during the accumulation phase.

#### Example

If an investor invests $5,000 in a variable annuity with a unit value of $25, the number of accumulation units would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Accumulation Units} = \frac{5,000}{25} = 200 {{< /katex >}}

### 10. Portfolio Construction

#### Diversification Formula

{{< katex >}} \text{Diversification} = \sum (\text{Weight of Asset} \times \text{Return of Asset}) {{< /katex >}}

#### Explanation

Diversification involves spreading investments across various assets to reduce risk. The formula calculates the expected return of a diversified portfolio.

#### Example

If a portfolio consists of 50% stocks with a return of 8% and 50% bonds with a return of 4%, the portfolio's expected return is:

{{< katex >}} \text{Diversification} = (0.5 \times 8) + (0.5 \times 4) = 4 + 2 = 6\% {{< /katex >}}
