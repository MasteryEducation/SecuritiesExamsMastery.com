## 5.2.3.2 403(b) Plans

### Introduction to 403(b) Plans

403(b) plans, also known as tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs), are retirement savings plans specifically designed for employees of public schools, certain non-profit organizations, and ministers. These plans provide a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement, similar to the more widely known 401(k) plans. Understanding the nuances of 403(b) plans is essential for those working within eligible organizations and for financial professionals advising clients in these sectors.

### Key Characteristics of 403(b) Plans

#### Eligibility and Participation

403(b) plans are available to employees of:

- Public schools and universities
- Certain non-profit organizations, including charitable organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
- Cooperative hospital service organizations
- Ministers employed by 501(c)(3) organizations or self-employed

Eligible employees can participate in a 403(b) plan by making salary deferral contributions, which are deducted from their paychecks pre-tax, thereby reducing their taxable income.

#### Similarities to 401(k) Plans

403(b) plans share several similarities with 401(k) plans:

- **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the maximum elective deferral limit is $22,500, with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 available for participants aged 50 and older.
- **Tax Treatment**: Contributions are made on a pre-tax basis, reducing taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawals are made during retirement.
- **Roth Option**: Many 403(b) plans offer a Roth option, allowing after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement, subject to certain conditions.

#### Investment Options

Investment options in 403(b) plans are typically limited to:

- **Annuity Contracts**: Offered by insurance companies, these contracts provide a guaranteed income stream in retirement.
- **Mutual Funds**: A range of mutual funds may be available, allowing participants to diversify their investments across various asset classes.

Unlike 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans are often more limited in investment choices, focusing primarily on annuities and mutual funds.

### Unique Features of 403(b) Plans

#### Catch-Up Contributions for Long-Service Employees

A distinctive feature of 403(b) plans is the opportunity for additional catch-up contributions for employees with 15 or more years of service with the same eligible employer. This provision allows an extra $3,000 per year, up to a lifetime maximum of $15,000, in addition to the standard catch-up contributions for those aged 50 and over.

#### Vesting Schedules

403(b) plans may have different vesting schedules compared to 401(k) plans. While employee contributions are always 100% vested, employer contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule, which dictates how long an employee must work for the employer before gaining full ownership of employer-contributed funds.

#### Loans and Hardship Withdrawals

Many 403(b) plans allow participants to take loans or hardship withdrawals under specific circumstances, such as medical expenses or purchasing a primary residence. However, these withdrawals may be subject to taxes and penalties if not repaid or if certain conditions are not met.

### Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

#### IRS Regulations

403(b) plans are governed by specific IRS regulations, which require compliance with contribution limits, nondiscrimination rules, and distribution requirements. Employers must ensure their plans meet these standards to maintain tax-advantaged status.

#### Plan Administration

Plan administrators must manage 403(b) plans according to IRS guidelines, including maintaining proper documentation, ensuring timely deposits of contributions, and providing participants with required disclosures and statements.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

#### Case Study: A Public School Teacher

Consider a public school teacher, Jane, who is 45 years old and has been contributing to her 403(b) plan for 20 years. Jane takes advantage of the additional catch-up contributions available due to her long service, maximizing her retirement savings. She allocates her investments between a diversified mutual fund portfolio and an annuity contract to balance growth and security.

#### Scenario: Minister's Retirement Planning

John, a minister employed by a 501(c)(3) organization, utilizes his 403(b) plan to save for retirement. He opts for the Roth 403(b) option, contributing after-tax dollars to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement. John also considers the plan's loan provisions to finance a home purchase, understanding the repayment terms and potential tax implications.

### Conclusion

403(b) plans are a vital retirement savings vehicle for employees of public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations. Understanding their structure, benefits, and unique features is crucial for maximizing retirement savings and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Financial professionals should be well-versed in these plans to provide sound advice to eligible participants.
