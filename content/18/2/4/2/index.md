## 2.4.2 Registration and Exemptions

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is a cornerstone of U.S. securities regulation, establishing the framework for the registration and regulation of investment advisers. Understanding the registration requirements, exemptions, and the critical role of Form ADV is essential for anyone preparing for the Series 6 Exam or working in the securities industry. This section will provide a comprehensive overview of these elements, equipping you with the knowledge needed to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively.

### Registration Requirements

Investment advisers are required to register with either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state securities authorities, depending on the amount of assets they manage. The registration process serves to protect investors by ensuring that advisers meet certain standards of conduct and disclosure.

#### SEC Registration

Investment advisers managing assets of $100 million or more are typically required to register with the SEC. This threshold is known as the "assets under management" (AUM) threshold. Advisers managing between $25 million and $100 million may choose to register with the SEC or state authorities, depending on their specific circumstances and the states in which they operate.

**Key Steps in SEC Registration:**

1. **Form ADV Submission**: Advisers must file Form ADV, a comprehensive form used to register with the SEC and state securities authorities. It consists of two parts:
   - **Part 1**: Contains information about the adviser's business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and any disciplinary events.
   - **Part 2**: A narrative brochure written in plain English that describes the types of advisory services offered, the adviser's fee schedule, disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the educational and business background of management and key advisory personnel.

2. **Filing Fees**: Advisers must pay a filing fee when submitting Form ADV. The fee varies based on the adviser's AUM.

3. **Annual Updates**: Advisers must update Form ADV annually and more frequently if certain information becomes materially inaccurate.

4. **Compliance with SEC Rules**: Advisers must comply with various SEC rules, including maintaining accurate records, adhering to advertising regulations, and implementing a robust compliance program.

#### State Registration

Advisers managing less than $100 million in assets are generally required to register with state securities authorities. Each state has its own registration requirements, which may include additional forms and fees. Advisers must be familiar with the specific requirements of each state in which they operate.

**State Registration Considerations:**

- **State-Specific Forms**: In addition to Form ADV, some states require additional documentation or forms.
- **Examination Requirements**: Some states may require advisers to pass specific exams, such as the Series 65 or Series 66, to qualify for registration.
- **State-Level Compliance**: Advisers must adhere to state regulations, which may include additional recordkeeping and disclosure requirements.

### Exemptions and Exclusions

While the Investment Advisers Act mandates registration for most advisers, there are several exemptions and exclusions that allow certain advisers to operate without registering with the SEC or state authorities. Understanding these exemptions is crucial for determining whether registration is necessary.

#### Private Fund Adviser Exemption

The private fund adviser exemption is one of the most significant exemptions under the Investment Advisers Act. It allows advisers who manage private funds and have less than $150 million in AUM in the United States to avoid SEC registration. However, these advisers must still comply with certain reporting requirements.

**Key Points of the Private Fund Adviser Exemption:**

- **Eligibility**: Advisers must manage only private funds, which are investment vehicles that are not required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
- **Filing Requirement**: Advisers must file reports with the SEC, even if they are exempt from registration.
- **State Registration**: Advisers relying on this exemption may still be subject to state registration requirements.

#### Intrastate Adviser Exemption

The intrastate adviser exemption applies to advisers whose clients are all residents of the state in which the adviser maintains its principal office and place of business. This exemption allows advisers to avoid SEC registration, although they may still need to register with state authorities.

**Conditions for the Intrastate Adviser Exemption:**

- **Client Residency**: All clients must be residents of the adviser's home state.
- **Principal Office**: The adviser's principal office must be located in the same state as its clients.
- **State Regulations**: Advisers must comply with state securities laws and registration requirements.

#### Other Exemptions and Exclusions

- **Advisers to Venture Capital Funds**: Advisers who solely advise venture capital funds are exempt from SEC registration but must file reports with the SEC.
- **Foreign Private Advisers**: Advisers with no place of business in the U.S. and fewer than 15 U.S. clients and investors in private funds, with less than $25 million in AUM attributable to U.S. clients and investors, are exempt from registration.
- **Certain Charitable Organizations and Church Plans**: Advisers to certain charitable organizations and church plans may also be exempt from registration.

### Importance of Form ADV

Form ADV is a critical component of the registration process for investment advisers. It serves as both a registration document and a disclosure tool, providing essential information to regulators and clients.

#### Components of Form ADV

- **Part 1**: Used by regulators to assess the adviser's business operations, affiliations, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Part 2**: Provides clients with detailed information about the adviser's services, fees, and conflicts of interest. It is designed to help clients make informed decisions about engaging the adviser's services.

#### Filing and Updating Form ADV

- **Initial Filing**: Advisers must file Form ADV electronically through the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) system.
- **Annual Updates**: Advisers must update Form ADV annually within 90 days of the end of their fiscal year. They must also amend the form promptly if any information becomes materially inaccurate.
- **Client Delivery**: Advisers must deliver Part 2 of Form ADV to clients initially and annually thereafter. They must also provide clients with a summary of material changes to the brochure.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To illustrate the application of registration requirements and exemptions, consider the following scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Small Advisory Firm

A small advisory firm manages $50 million in assets and operates primarily in one state. The firm must register with the state securities authority and comply with state regulations. It may also need to file Form ADV and pay state filing fees.

#### Scenario 2: Private Fund Adviser

An adviser manages a private equity fund with $120 million in assets. The adviser qualifies for the private fund adviser exemption and is not required to register with the SEC. However, the adviser must file reports with the SEC and may need to register with state authorities.

#### Scenario 3: Intrastate Adviser

An adviser operates exclusively within one state, serving only local clients. The adviser qualifies for the intrastate adviser exemption and avoids SEC registration. The adviser must still register with the state securities authority and comply with state regulations.

### Real-World Applications and Compliance Considerations

Investment advisers must navigate a complex regulatory environment to ensure compliance with registration requirements and exemptions. Key considerations include:

- **Understanding Regulatory Obligations**: Advisers must be well-versed in both federal and state regulations to determine their registration obligations accurately.
- **Maintaining Accurate Records**: Compliance with recordkeeping requirements is essential for both registered and exempt advisers.
- **Implementing Robust Compliance Programs**: Advisers should establish comprehensive compliance programs to monitor and address regulatory changes and ensure ongoing compliance.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices**:
  - Regularly review and update Form ADV to ensure accuracy and compliance.
  - Stay informed about regulatory changes that may affect registration requirements or exemptions.
  - Implement a compliance calendar to track filing deadlines and regulatory obligations.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Failing to update Form ADV promptly when material changes occur.
  - Overlooking state registration requirements when relying on federal exemptions.
  - Neglecting to deliver Part 2 of Form ADV to clients as required.

### Summary

Understanding the registration requirements and exemptions under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is crucial for investment advisers and those preparing for the Series 6 Exam. By mastering the intricacies of Form ADV and the various exemptions available, you can navigate the regulatory landscape with confidence and ensure compliance with both federal and state securities laws.
