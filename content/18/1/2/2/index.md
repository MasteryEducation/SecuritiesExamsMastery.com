## 1.2.2 Time Allotment

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 Exam is a crucial step for professionals seeking to become registered representatives, specializing in investment company and variable contracts products. One of the key components of succeeding in this exam is effective time management. This section will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the time allotted for the Series 6 Exam, strategies to manage your time effectively, and tips to ensure you complete the exam within the given timeframe.

### Total Time Given for the Series 6 Exam

The Series 6 Exam is designed to test your knowledge and understanding of investment company and variable contracts products. You are given **90 minutes** to complete the exam. This time frame is strategically set to assess your ability to recall information quickly and apply it under pressure, which is a critical skill in the securities industry.

### Understanding the Exam Structure

Before diving into time management strategies, it's essential to understand the structure of the exam. The Series 6 Exam consists of 50 multiple-choice questions. These questions cover a wide range of topics, including mutual funds, variable annuities, and regulatory fundamentals. Here's a quick breakdown of what you can expect:

- **Investment Company Products and Variable Contracts**: Approximately 50% of the exam.
- **Securities and Taxation**: Approximately 20% of the exam.
- **Economic Factors and Business Information**: Approximately 10% of the exam.
- **Client Management and Ethical Practices**: Approximately 20% of the exam.

### Time Management Strategies

Efficient time management is crucial to ensure you answer all questions within the 90-minute limit. Here are some strategies to help you manage your time effectively:

#### 1. Allocate Time Per Question

With 90 minutes and 50 questions, you have an average of **1.8 minutes per question**. However, it's wise to allocate your time based on the complexity of the questions:

- **Easy Questions**: Spend about 1 minute. These are questions you can answer quickly with confidence.
- **Moderate Questions**: Spend about 2 minutes. These require a bit more thought and calculation.
- **Difficult Questions**: Spend up to 3 minutes. These are questions that may require more analysis or involve complex scenarios.

#### 2. Prioritize Questions

Begin by scanning through the exam to identify questions you can answer quickly. This strategy helps build confidence and ensures you secure marks early on. If you encounter a difficult question, mark it and move on. You can return to it later if time permits.

#### 3. Use the Process of Elimination

For multiple-choice questions, eliminate obviously incorrect answers first. This increases your chances of selecting the correct answer from the remaining options. This technique can save time and reduce the cognitive load during the exam.

#### 4. Keep Track of Time

Regularly check the time to ensure you're on track. Divide the exam into segments (e.g., 25 questions in 45 minutes) and aim to complete each segment within the allotted time. This approach prevents you from spending too much time on any single question or section.

#### 5. Practice with Timed Exams

Before the actual exam, practice with timed mock exams. This will help you get accustomed to the pressure of the time limit and improve your pacing. Use practice exams that simulate the Series 6 Exam format to enhance your familiarity with the question types and difficulty level.

### Pacing: The Key to Success

Pacing is crucial to ensure you have enough time to review your answers. Here are some tips to help you pace yourself:

- **Start Strong**: Begin with questions you find easy to build momentum.
- **Stay Calm**: Anxiety can slow you down. Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, to maintain focus.
- **Review if Time Allows**: If you finish early, use the remaining time to review your answers, especially the ones you were unsure about.

### Glossary

- **Time Management**: Efficiently organizing and planning how to divide your time among various exam sections.
