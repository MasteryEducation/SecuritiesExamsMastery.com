By understanding the functions and responsibilities of these agencies, you will be better equipped to navigate the financial markets and prepare for the U.S. Securities Exams.

### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a U.S. government agency established in 1934, following the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. Its primary mission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. The SEC achieves these goals through the enforcement of federal securities laws, oversight of securities exchanges, and regulation of securities firms and professionals.

#### Key Functions of the SEC

1. **Enforcement of Securities Laws**: The SEC enforces a wide range of securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These laws require public companies to disclose important financial information, ensuring transparency and fairness in the markets.

2. **Regulation of Securities Markets and Participants**: The SEC oversees securities exchanges, brokers, and dealers. It ensures that these entities operate in a manner that protects investors and promotes market integrity.

3. **Review and Approval of Corporate Filings**: Public companies must file periodic reports with the SEC, including annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports. The SEC reviews these filings to ensure compliance with disclosure requirements.

4. **Investor Education and Advocacy**: The SEC provides resources and tools to help investors make informed decisions. It also advocates for investor rights and works to prevent fraud and abuse in the markets.

#### Importance of the SEC

The SEC plays a vital role in maintaining investor confidence and ensuring the smooth functioning of financial markets. By enforcing securities laws and promoting transparency, the SEC helps prevent fraud and market manipulation. This, in turn, fosters a stable environment for capital formation, allowing businesses to raise funds and grow.

### Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) that oversees brokerage firms and their registered representatives. Although it operates independently, FINRA is subject to SEC oversight. FINRA's mission is to protect investors by ensuring the integrity of the securities industry.

4. **Investor Education and Protection**: FINRA provides educational resources and tools to help investors make informed decisions. It also operates the FINRA Investor Education Foundation, which promotes financial literacy.

#### Importance of FINRA

FINRA plays a critical role in maintaining investor trust and confidence in the securities industry.

3. **Oversight of Market Participants**: The CFTC regulates market participants, including futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators, and swap dealers. It ensures that these entities comply with registration and reporting requirements.

4. **Market Surveillance and Risk Management**: The CFTC monitors trading activity and market conditions to identify and mitigate potential risks. It also works to enhance the resilience and stability of the derivatives markets.

3. **Capital Formation**: By maintaining a stable and transparent market environment, regulatory compliance facilitates capital formation. This allows businesses to raise funds and grow, supporting economic development.

#### Impact of Regulations on Financial Markets

Regulations have a significant impact on the functioning of financial markets. They influence the behavior of market participants, the structure of markets, and the flow of capital. While regulations can impose costs and constraints, they also provide essential protections and promote market stability.
