## 5.4 Federal Agency Securities

Federal agency securities are debt instruments issued by various government-sponsored entities (GSEs) and federal agencies to support specific sectors of the economy, such as housing, agriculture, and education. These securities are vital components of the U.S. financial system and are often considered safe investments due to their implicit or explicit backing by the federal government. In this section, we will explore the roles of key federal agencies, the types of securities they issue, and the investment characteristics and considerations associated with these securities.

### 5.4.1 Overview of Federal Agencies

Federal agencies and GSEs play a crucial role in providing liquidity and stability to various sectors. They issue securities to fund their operations and support their mandates. Some of the prominent agencies include:

- **Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA):** Also known as Sallie Mae, this organization was created to support the student loan market by providing liquidity and facilitating the issuance of student loans.
- **Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB):** These banks provide financial support to the agricultural sector, offering loans and credit services to farmers and agricultural businesses.
- **Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB):** These banks provide liquidity to member financial institutions to support housing finance and community investment.
- **Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA):** A federally owned corporation that issues bonds to finance its operations in electricity generation and environmental stewardship.

### 5.4.2 Types of Securities Issued

Federal agencies issue various types of securities, including:

- **Agency Bonds:** These are debt securities issued by federal agencies and GSEs. They are typically considered low-risk investments due to their government backing.
- **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** Issued primarily by housing-related agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these securities are backed by pools of mortgages.
- **Notes and Bills:** Short-term debt instruments that provide liquidity to the issuing agency and offer investors a safe place to park their funds.

#### 5.4.2.1 Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA)

Sallie Mae, originally a GSE, was established to provide liquidity to the student loan market. Although it has since privatized, its legacy securities remain relevant. Sallie Mae issued debt securities to fund student loans, which were considered safe investments due to their federal backing.

#### 5.4.2.2 Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB)

The FFCB issues a variety of securities, including bonds and discount notes, to support agricultural lending. These securities are generally considered low-risk investments due to the strong credit quality of the issuing banks and their importance to the agricultural sector.

### 5.4.3 Investment Characteristics and Considerations

Federal agency securities are attractive to investors for several reasons:

- **Credit Quality:** Many federal agency securities are considered low-risk due to their implicit or explicit government backing. However, it's essential to differentiate between GSEs and fully government-backed agencies.
- **Yield:** These securities often offer higher yields than U.S. Treasury securities, making them attractive to income-seeking investors.
- **Liquidity:** Agency securities are typically liquid, with active secondary markets, allowing investors to buy and sell them with relative ease.
- **Tax Considerations:** Interest from some federal agency securities may be exempt from state and local taxes, enhancing their appeal to certain investors.

#### 5.4.3.1 Risk Considerations

While federal agency securities are generally low-risk, investors should be aware of potential risks:

- **Interest Rate Risk:** Like all fixed-income securities, agency bonds are subject to interest rate risk. Rising interest rates can lead to declining bond prices.
- **Prepayment Risk:** This is particularly relevant for mortgage-backed securities, where homeowners may refinance or pay off their mortgages early, affecting the cash flows to investors.
- **Credit Risk:** Although minimal, there is still some credit risk associated with GSEs, as they are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

### 5.4.4 Case Study: Sallie Mae and Federal Farm Credit Banks

#### Sallie Mae

Originally established as a GSE, Sallie Mae played a pivotal role in the student loan market by purchasing student loans from lenders, thus providing them with liquidity. Although it has since transitioned to a private entity, its legacy securities continue to trade in the market. These securities were initially backed by the federal government, making them attractive to risk-averse investors.

#### Federal Farm Credit Banks

The FFCB system consists of a network of borrower-owned financial institutions that provide credit and financial services to the agricultural sector. By issuing bonds and discount notes, the FFCB raises funds to support its lending activities. These securities are highly rated due to the strong creditworthiness of the Farm Credit System and its importance to the U.S. agricultural economy.

### 5.4.5 Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

Federal agency securities are subject to various regulatory requirements to ensure transparency and investor protection. Key considerations include:

- **Disclosure Requirements:** Issuers must provide detailed information about the securities, including their terms, risks, and financial condition.
- **Registration Exemptions:** Many federal agency securities are exempt from SEC registration, but issuers must still comply with applicable disclosure and reporting requirements.
- **Investor Suitability:** Brokers and financial advisors must ensure that these securities are suitable for their clients' investment objectives and risk tolerance.

### 5.4.6 Practical Examples and Scenarios

To illustrate the practical application of federal agency securities, consider the following scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** An investor seeking a low-risk investment with a higher yield than Treasury securities might consider purchasing FFCB bonds. These bonds offer a balance of safety and yield, making them suitable for conservative investors.
- **Scenario 2:** A financial advisor recommends mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae to a client looking for income-generating investments. The advisor explains the potential risks, including prepayment risk, and ensures the client understands how these securities fit into their overall portfolio strategy.

### 5.4.7 Summary and Key Takeaways

Federal agency securities are integral to the U.S. financial system, providing funding and liquidity to essential sectors such as housing, agriculture, and education. These securities offer investors a combination of safety, yield, and liquidity, making them an attractive option for many portfolios. However, investors must be aware of the risks and regulatory considerations associated with these instruments.

By understanding the roles of agencies like Sallie Mae and the Federal Farm Credit Banks, the types of securities they issue, and the investment characteristics they offer, you can make informed decisions and effectively prepare for the Series 7 Exam.
