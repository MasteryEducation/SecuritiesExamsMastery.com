## 5.2.2 Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)

The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, plays a pivotal role in the U.S. housing finance system. As a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), Fannie Mae operates in the secondary mortgage market, providing liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market. This section will delve into the operations of Fannie Mae, its implicit government backing, associated risks, and an analysis of FNMA securities.

### Understanding Fannie Mae's Operations

Fannie Mae was established in 1938 as part of the New Deal to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgages in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). This process involves purchasing mortgages from lenders, pooling them, and selling them as securities to investors. By doing so, Fannie Mae ensures that lenders have a steady supply of funds to issue new mortgages, thereby supporting homeownership.

#### The Role in the Secondary Mortgage Market

Fannie Mae's primary function is to purchase mortgages from banks and other financial institutions. These purchases provide liquidity to lenders, allowing them to offer more loans to consumers. The mortgages acquired by Fannie Mae are typically conforming loans, which meet specific criteria set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).

Once these loans are purchased, Fannie Mae pools them into mortgage-backed securities. These MBS are then sold to investors, who receive periodic payments derived from the principal and interest payments made by homeowners. This securitization process helps spread the risk of mortgage lending across a wide range of investors, thereby stabilizing the housing finance system.

#### Implicit Government Backing

One of the critical aspects of Fannie Mae's operations is its implicit government guarantee. Although Fannie Mae is a privately owned corporation, it is chartered by Congress. This unique status has led to the perception that the U.S. government would support Fannie Mae in times of financial distress, although there is no explicit legal obligation to do so. This implicit guarantee has historically allowed Fannie Mae to borrow at lower interest rates than purely private entities, reflecting the market's belief in government support.

##### Risks Associated with Implicit Guarantee

The implicit guarantee, while beneficial in terms of borrowing costs, introduces several risks. It can lead to moral hazard, where Fannie Mae might engage in riskier activities under the assumption of government support. Additionally, during the 2008 financial crisis, the market's reliance on the implicit guarantee was tested, leading to significant government intervention. The U.S. Treasury placed Fannie Mae into conservatorship, providing substantial financial support to stabilize the housing market.

### Analysis of FNMA Securities

Fannie Mae issues various types of securities, primarily focusing on mortgage-backed securities. These securities are attractive to investors due to their perceived safety and steady income stream. However, understanding their structure and associated risks is crucial for anyone involved in the securities industry.

#### Types of FNMA Securities

1. **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** These are the most common securities issued by Fannie Mae. They consist of pools of mortgages that provide investors with regular payments from the underlying mortgage loans.

2. **Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs):** These are more complex securities that divide the cash flows from MBS into different tranches, each with varying risk and return profiles.

3. **Debt Securities:** Fannie Mae also issues debt securities to raise capital. These include benchmark notes and bonds, which are considered low-risk investments due to the implicit government backing.

#### Risks and Considerations

Investing in FNMA securities involves several risks, including interest rate risk, prepayment risk, and credit risk. Interest rate risk arises because changes in interest rates can affect the value of the securities. Prepayment risk occurs when homeowners refinance or pay off their mortgages early, affecting the expected cash flows to investors. Credit risk, while mitigated by the implicit government guarantee, still exists if the underlying borrowers default on their loans.

### Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

Fannie Mae operates under the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which sets the standards for the loans it can purchase and securitize. Compliance with these regulations is crucial for maintaining the integrity and stability of the housing finance system.

#### Key Regulations

- **Conforming Loan Limits:** These are the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae can purchase. They are adjusted annually based on changes in the housing market.
  
- **Underwriting Standards:** Fannie Mae sets specific criteria for the creditworthiness of borrowers, ensuring that the loans it purchases are of high quality.

- **Capital Requirements:** As a GSE, Fannie Mae is subject to capital requirements to ensure it can absorb potential losses and continue operations during financial downturns.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate Fannie Mae's impact on the housing market, consider the following scenarios:

#### Case Study: The 2008 Financial Crisis

During the 2008 financial crisis, the housing market experienced a severe downturn, leading to widespread defaults on mortgage loans. Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, faced significant financial distress due to their exposure to the mortgage market. The U.S. government intervened, placing both entities into conservatorship and providing financial support to stabilize the market. This intervention highlighted the importance of Fannie Mae's role in the housing finance system and the implications of its implicit government guarantee.

#### Example: Securitization Process

Imagine a bank issues a $200,000 mortgage to a homebuyer. Fannie Mae purchases this mortgage, pools it with others, and creates a mortgage-backed security. Investors purchase shares of this MBS, receiving payments derived from the homeowner's monthly mortgage payments. This process allows the bank to issue more loans, supporting homeownership and economic growth.

### Conclusion and Future Outlook

Fannie Mae remains a cornerstone of the U.S. housing finance system, providing liquidity and stability to the mortgage market. While its implicit government backing offers benefits, it also introduces risks that must be carefully managed. Understanding the operations, risks, and securities associated with Fannie Mae is crucial for anyone involved in the securities industry, particularly those preparing for the Series 7 Exam.

As the housing market continues to evolve, Fannie Mae's role and the regulatory environment may change, impacting its operations and the securities it issues. Staying informed about these developments is essential for securities professionals.
