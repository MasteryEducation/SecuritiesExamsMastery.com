## 26.2.1 Filing Claims

Filing a claim in FINRA arbitration is a critical step for resolving disputes in the securities industry. This process involves submitting a Statement of Claim, which outlines the nature of the dispute, the parties involved, and the relief sought. Understanding the requirements, fees, time limits, and procedures for serving the respondent is essential for anyone preparing for the Series 7 Exam, as well as for professionals involved in securities arbitration. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of the filing process, including best practices for drafting effective claims.

### Understanding the Statement of Claim

The Statement of Claim is the foundational document in a FINRA arbitration proceeding. It serves to formally initiate the arbitration process and must clearly articulate the claimant's grievances, the facts of the case, and the specific relief or damages being sought. Here are the key components and considerations when preparing a Statement of Claim:

#### Key Components of a Statement of Claim

1. **Identification of Parties**: Clearly identify the claimant(s) and respondent(s). This includes providing full names, addresses, and any relevant identifying information such as account numbers or firm affiliations.

2. **Statement of Facts**: Provide a detailed narrative of the events leading to the dispute. This section should be factual, chronological, and include all relevant details that support the claimant's case.

3. **Legal Claims**: Outline the legal basis for the claim. This may include violations of securities laws, breach of contract, negligence, or other relevant legal theories.

4. **Relief Sought**: Specify the type of relief or damages being requested. This could include monetary compensation, specific performance, or other remedies.

5. **Supporting Documents**: Attach any relevant documents that support the claim, such as account statements, correspondence, contracts, or expert reports.

#### Drafting an Effective Statement of Claim

To draft a compelling Statement of Claim, consider the following guidelines:

- **Clarity and Precision**: Use clear and concise language. Avoid jargon and ensure that the narrative is easy to follow.

- **Factual Accuracy**: Ensure that all factual statements are accurate and supported by evidence. Inaccuracies can undermine the credibility of the claim.

- **Legal Coherence**: Clearly connect the facts to the legal claims. Explain how the respondent's actions constitute a violation of the law or contract.

- **Compelling Storytelling**: While maintaining objectivity, present the facts in a way that engages the arbitrators and highlights the injustice experienced by the claimant.

### Fees and Costs Associated with Filing a Claim

Filing a claim in FINRA arbitration involves certain fees and costs. Understanding these financial aspects is crucial for claimants to budget appropriately and for exam candidates to grasp the practicalities of arbitration.

#### Initial Filing Fees

- **Filing Fee**: Claimants must pay a filing fee when submitting the Statement of Claim. The fee amount depends on the size of the claim and is outlined in the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure.

- **Hearing Session Fees**: Additional fees may be incurred for each hearing session scheduled during the arbitration process. These fees are typically shared between the parties.

#### Cost Considerations

- **Attorney Fees**: While not mandatory, many claimants choose to engage legal counsel, which can add significant costs.

- **Expert Witness Fees**: If the case involves complex financial issues, hiring expert witnesses may be necessary, adding to the overall expense.

- **Administrative Costs**: Other costs may include copying, mailing, and travel expenses related to the arbitration proceedings.

### Time Limits for Filing a Claim

Time limits, or statutes of limitations, are critical considerations in arbitration. Failing to file within the prescribed time frame can result in the dismissal of the claim.

#### Statutes of Limitations

- **General Time Frame**: The FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure generally requires claims to be filed within six years from the occurrence or event giving rise to the claim.

- **Tolling Agreements**: In some cases, parties may agree to toll, or pause, the statute of limitations, allowing more time to file the claim.

- **State Laws**: Be aware that state laws may impose different time limits, which can affect the arbitration process.

### Serving the Respondent

Once the Statement of Claim is prepared and filed, it must be served on the respondent. This step is crucial for ensuring that the respondent is formally notified of the arbitration proceedings.

#### Methods of Service

- **Direct Service**: The claimant or their representative can directly serve the respondent with the Statement of Claim and accompanying documents.

- **FINRA Service**: Alternatively, FINRA can serve the respondent on behalf of the claimant. This method ensures compliance with service requirements and can be more efficient.

#### Proof of Service

- **Affidavit of Service**: The claimant must provide proof that the respondent has been served, typically in the form of an affidavit or declaration of service.

- **Service Challenges**: If the respondent disputes service, the claimant may need to provide additional evidence or re-serve the documents.

### Best Practices for Filing Claims

To maximize the effectiveness of a claim and increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome, consider the following best practices:

#### Comprehensive Preparation

- **Gather Evidence**: Collect all relevant documents and evidence before drafting the Statement of Claim. This ensures that the claim is well-supported and credible.

- **Consult Legal Counsel**: While not required, consulting with an attorney experienced in securities arbitration can provide valuable insights and strengthen the claim.

#### Strategic Drafting

- **Focus on Key Issues**: Highlight the most compelling aspects of the case and focus on the key issues that will resonate with the arbitrators.

- **Anticipate Defenses**: Consider potential defenses the respondent may raise and address them proactively in the Statement of Claim.

#### Effective Communication

- **Maintain Professionalism**: Use a professional tone throughout the claim and avoid inflammatory language or personal attacks.

- **Engage the Arbitrators**: Craft the narrative in a way that engages the arbitrators and clearly communicates the claimant's position and desired outcome.

### Real-World Applications and Case Studies

Understanding the practical application of filing claims in FINRA arbitration can provide valuable insights for exam candidates and professionals alike. Consider the following case studies and scenarios:

#### Case Study 1: Breach of Fiduciary Duty

A claimant alleges that their financial advisor breached their fiduciary duty by making unsuitable investment recommendations. The Statement of Claim outlines the advisor's failure to consider the claimant's risk tolerance and financial goals, resulting in significant financial losses. The claim seeks monetary compensation for the losses incurred.

#### Case Study 2: Unauthorized Trading

In this scenario, a claimant files a claim against a brokerage firm for unauthorized trading in their account. The Statement of Claim includes detailed account statements and correspondence showing that the trades were executed without the claimant's consent. The claim seeks reimbursement for the losses and punitive damages for the firm's misconduct.

### Conclusion

Filing a claim in FINRA arbitration is a complex process that requires careful preparation and strategic thinking. By understanding the requirements for submitting a Statement of Claim, associated fees, time limits, and serving the respondent, claimants can navigate the arbitration process more effectively. For those preparing for the Series 7 Exam, mastering these concepts is essential for success in both the exam and future professional practice.
