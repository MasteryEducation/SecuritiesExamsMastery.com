## 6.2.3 Taxable Municipal Bonds

Municipal bonds have long been a staple in the investment portfolios of individuals seeking tax-exempt income. However, not all municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes. Taxable municipal bonds, such as Build America Bonds (BABs), offer unique opportunities and considerations for investors. In this section, we will delve into the world of taxable municipal bonds, exploring their characteristics, the reasons behind their issuance, and how they compare to their tax-exempt counterparts.

### Introduction to Taxable Municipal Bonds

Taxable municipal bonds are debt securities issued by municipalities, such as states, cities, or counties, that do not qualify for federal tax exemption. While traditionally, municipal bonds have been known for their tax-exempt status, taxable municipal bonds provide municipalities with an alternative financing option that can attract a broader range of investors, including those who do not benefit from tax-exempt income.

### Build America Bonds (BABs)

One of the most prominent examples of taxable municipal bonds is the Build America Bonds (BABs) program, introduced as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. BABs were designed to stimulate the economy by providing state and local governments with access to the capital markets at reduced borrowing costs.

#### Characteristics of Build America Bonds

- **Taxable Interest**: Unlike traditional municipal bonds, the interest earned on BABs is subject to federal income tax. This feature makes them attractive to investors in lower tax brackets or those who have exhausted their tax-exempt investment options.
  
- **Federal Subsidies**: BABs offer a federal subsidy to issuers, either through a direct subsidy payment to the issuer or a tax credit to the bondholder. The direct subsidy option, known as the Direct Payment BABs, provides issuers with a subsidy of 35% of the interest cost, effectively lowering the cost of borrowing.

- **Market Reach**: By being taxable, BABs can attract a broader investor base, including pension funds and foreign investors, who typically do not benefit from the tax-exempt status of traditional municipal bonds.

#### Incentives for Issuers

The primary incentive for municipalities to issue taxable bonds like BABs is the ability to access a wider pool of investors and potentially lower borrowing costs through federal subsidies. This can be particularly advantageous during times when traditional tax-exempt bonds may not attract sufficient investor interest or when the municipality needs to finance large-scale infrastructure projects.

### Other Taxable Municipal Bonds

In addition to BABs, there are other types of taxable municipal bonds that issuers may consider:

- **Taxable Municipal Revenue Bonds**: These bonds are often issued to finance projects that do not qualify for tax-exempt status under federal law, such as sports stadiums or convention centers. The revenue generated from these projects is used to pay back the bondholders.

- **Private Activity Bonds**: While typically tax-exempt, certain private activity bonds may become taxable if they do not meet specific criteria set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These bonds finance projects that benefit private entities, such as airports or industrial parks.

### Comparison Between Taxable and Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds

Understanding the differences between taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds is crucial for investors and issuers alike:

| Feature                        | Taxable Municipal Bonds                      | Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Tax Treatment**              | Subject to federal income tax               | Generally exempt from federal income tax   |
| **Investor Base**              | Broader, includes non-tax-sensitive investors | Primarily tax-sensitive investors          |
| **Yield**                      | Typically higher to compensate for taxability | Typically lower due to tax benefits        |
| **Use of Proceeds**            | Broader, includes non-qualifying projects   | Limited to qualifying public projects      |
| **Marketability**              | Attracts institutional and international investors | Primarily domestic retail investors        |

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Case Study: The Success of Build America Bonds

The introduction of BABs was a significant success, with over $181 billion issued between 2009 and 2010. The program allowed municipalities to finance infrastructure projects at a time when traditional municipal markets were under stress. For example, the California State Government issued BABs to fund transportation projects, benefiting from the federal subsidy to reduce interest costs.

#### Example: Taxable Revenue Bonds for a Sports Stadium

Consider a city that issues taxable municipal revenue bonds to finance a new sports stadium. The project generates revenue through ticket sales, concessions, and naming rights, which are used to pay interest and principal on the bonds. Investors are attracted by the higher yields compared to tax-exempt bonds, and the city benefits from a broader investor base.

### Regulatory Considerations and Compliance

When dealing with taxable municipal bonds, issuers and investors must be aware of specific regulatory requirements:

- **Disclosure Requirements**: Issuers must provide detailed disclosures about the bond's tax status, use of proceeds, and financial health of the project or municipality. This information is crucial for investors to assess the bond's risk and return profile.

- **IRS Regulations**: Taxable municipal bonds must comply with IRS regulations regarding the use of proceeds and the nature of the project being financed. Failure to comply can result in penalties or the loss of tax benefits.

### Investment Strategies and Considerations

Investors considering taxable municipal bonds should evaluate several factors:

- **Tax Bracket**: Investors in lower tax brackets may find taxable municipal bonds more attractive due to their higher yields compared to tax-exempt bonds.

- **Portfolio Diversification**: Taxable municipal bonds can provide diversification benefits, especially for portfolios heavily weighted towards tax-exempt securities.

- **Risk Assessment**: As with any investment, assessing the creditworthiness of the issuer and the project's viability is crucial. Ratings from agencies like Moody's or Standard & Poor's can provide insights into the bond's risk profile.

### Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Taxable municipal bonds, including Build America Bonds, offer unique opportunities for both issuers and investors. While they lack the federal tax exemption of traditional municipal bonds, their higher yields and broader investor appeal make them an attractive option in certain circumstances. Understanding the nuances of taxable municipal bonds, including their regulatory requirements and market dynamics, is essential for making informed investment decisions.
