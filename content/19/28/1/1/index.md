## 28.1.1 Sponsored vs. Unsponsored ADRs

American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) offer a way for U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without dealing with the complexities of foreign securities markets. ADRs are negotiable certificates issued by a U.S. depositary bank, representing a specified number of shares in a foreign stock. They are traded on U.S. stock exchanges, just like domestic shares. There are two main types of ADRs: sponsored and unsponsored. Understanding the differences between these two types is crucial for anyone preparing for the Series 7 Exam and for professionals in the securities industry.

### Understanding Sponsored ADRs

**Sponsored ADRs** are created when a foreign company enters into a formal agreement with a U.S. depositary bank to facilitate the issuance of ADRs. This arrangement means the foreign company is directly involved in the process, providing certain benefits and assurances to investors.

#### Key Features of Sponsored ADRs

- **Direct Involvement:** The foreign company actively participates in the ADR program, ensuring that the ADRs are aligned with the company's interests and strategic goals.
- **Disclosure and Reporting:** Sponsored ADRs are subject to the same reporting and disclosure requirements as U.S. companies. This includes providing financial statements and other pertinent information to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
- **Investor Rights:** Holders of sponsored ADRs typically enjoy more rights, such as voting rights and the ability to receive dividends directly from the company.
- **Levels of Sponsorship:** Sponsored ADRs can be categorized into three levels, each with varying degrees of compliance and trading capabilities:
  - **Level I:** Traded over-the-counter (OTC) with minimal SEC reporting requirements.
  - **Level II:** Listed on U.S. stock exchanges, requiring full SEC compliance and reporting.
  - **Level III:** Allows the foreign company to raise capital in the U.S. market through public offerings, with the most stringent reporting requirements.

#### Advantages of Sponsored ADRs

- **Transparency:** Due to SEC reporting requirements, investors have access to comprehensive financial information.
- **Market Access:** Sponsored ADRs can be listed on major U.S. exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of trading.
- **Investor Confidence:** The involvement of the foreign company often instills greater confidence among investors due to the alignment of interests.

#### Disadvantages of Sponsored ADRs

- **Cost:** The establishment and maintenance of a sponsored ADR program can be costly for the foreign company, which may be reflected in the ADR fees.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** The foreign company must comply with U.S. securities regulations, which can be burdensome.

### Exploring Unsponsored ADRs

**Unsponsored ADRs** are created without the direct involvement of the foreign company. Instead, one or more U.S. depositary banks independently issue these ADRs, often leading to multiple unsponsored ADRs for the same foreign stock.

#### Key Features of Unsponsored ADRs

- **No Direct Company Involvement:** The foreign company does not participate in the ADR issuance process, which can lead to inconsistencies in information and investor rights.
- **Limited Disclosure:** Unsponsored ADRs are not subject to the same level of SEC reporting and disclosure as sponsored ADRs, leading to less transparency.
- **Multiple Depositaries:** Different depositary banks may issue unsponsored ADRs for the same foreign company, each with its own terms and conditions.
- **Investor Rights:** Holders of unsponsored ADRs typically have fewer rights, such as limited or no voting rights.

#### Advantages of Unsponsored ADRs

- **Lower Costs:** The absence of a formal agreement with the foreign company reduces costs, potentially leading to lower fees for investors.
- **Ease of Establishment:** Unsponsored ADRs can be established more quickly and with less regulatory burden.

#### Disadvantages of Unsponsored ADRs

- **Lack of Transparency:** With limited disclosure requirements, investors may have less information about the foreign company.
- **Inconsistent Information:** Multiple ADRs for the same company can lead to discrepancies in information and investor rights.
- **Limited Investor Rights:** Investors may not have the same level of rights as those holding sponsored ADRs, such as voting rights.

### Comparing Sponsored and Unsponsored ADRs

The choice between sponsored and unsponsored ADRs depends on various factors, including investor preferences, the foreign company's involvement, and the level of regulatory compliance desired. Here's a comparison of the two:

| Feature                  | Sponsored ADRs                               | Unsponsored ADRs                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Company Involvement**  | Direct involvement                           | No direct involvement                        |
| **Disclosure**           | Full SEC disclosure and reporting            | Limited disclosure                           |
| **Investor Rights**      | Typically includes voting and dividend rights| Limited rights, often no voting rights       |
| **Trading Venues**       | Can be listed on major U.S. exchanges        | Typically traded OTC                         |
| **Cost**                 | Higher due to compliance and agreements      | Lower due to lack of formal agreements       |
| **Regulatory Compliance**| Subject to U.S. securities regulations       | Minimal compliance requirements              |

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example 1: Sponsored ADR - Toyota Motor Corporation

Toyota Motor Corporation, a major Japanese automaker, has a sponsored ADR program in the U.S. Toyota's ADRs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), providing U.S. investors with easy access to the company's shares. As a Level II ADR, Toyota complies with SEC reporting requirements, offering transparency and investor confidence.

#### Example 2: Unsponsored ADR - Nestlé S.A.

Nestlé S.A., a Swiss multinational food and beverage company, has unsponsored ADRs traded in the U.S. market. Multiple U.S. depositary banks issue these ADRs, leading to variations in terms and conditions. While this allows for lower costs, investors may face challenges due to limited information and rights.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Scenarios

Investors should consider the implications of choosing between sponsored and unsponsored ADRs. Sponsored ADRs offer greater transparency and investor rights, making them suitable for those seeking a higher level of involvement and information. Unsponsored ADRs, on the other hand, may appeal to cost-conscious investors willing to accept limited rights and disclosures.

#### Regulatory Considerations

- **SEC Regulations:** Sponsored ADRs must comply with SEC regulations, providing investors with access to financial statements and other disclosures.
- **Depositary Agreements:** Sponsored ADRs involve formal agreements between the foreign company and the U.S. depositary bank, ensuring alignment of interests.
- **Investor Protection:** The involvement of the foreign company in sponsored ADRs often leads to better investor protection and confidence.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Due Diligence:** Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, understanding the implications of sponsored versus unsponsored ADRs.
- **Consider Investor Rights:** Evaluate the level of investor rights and transparency offered by the ADR type.
- **Assess Costs and Fees:** Consider the cost implications of both sponsored and unsponsored ADRs, including potential fees and charges.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Disclosure Differences:** Failing to recognize the differences in disclosure requirements can lead to uninformed investment decisions.
- **Overlooking Investor Rights:** Investors may overlook the importance of voting and dividend rights, impacting their investment outcomes.

### Conclusion

Understanding the differences between sponsored and unsponsored ADRs is essential for anyone involved in the U.S. securities markets. Sponsored ADRs offer greater transparency and investor rights, while unsponsored ADRs provide a cost-effective alternative with limited rights and disclosures. By considering the implications of each type, investors can make informed decisions that align with their investment goals and risk tolerance.
