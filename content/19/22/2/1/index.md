## 22.2.1 Customer Identification Program (CIP)

The Customer Identification Program (CIP) is a critical component of the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework, mandated by the USA PATRIOT Act. It requires financial institutions, including broker-dealers, to implement procedures to verify the identity of individuals and entities opening accounts. This section provides an in-depth exploration of CIP, discussing its importance, procedures, acceptable identification documents, and verification methods.

### Overview of the Customer Identification Program (CIP)

The CIP is designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by ensuring that financial institutions know their customers. It forms part of the broader "Know Your Customer" (KYC) requirements, which aim to identify and verify the identity of account holders. The CIP must be integrated into a financial institution's AML program and is subject to regulatory oversight.

### Key Objectives of CIP

1. **Verification of Identity**: Ensure that the identity of each customer is verified through reliable documentation.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risk associated with each customer to prevent illicit activities.
3. **Recordkeeping**: Maintain accurate records of the information used to verify identities.
4. **Notification**: Inform customers about the CIP requirements and the necessity of providing identification.

### Regulatory Framework

The CIP requirements are primarily governed by the USA PATRIOT Act, particularly Section 326, which mandates that financial institutions implement reasonable procedures for verifying the identity of any person opening an account. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide additional guidance and enforcement.

### Procedures for Verifying Customer Identity

The CIP must outline procedures for verifying the identity of customers, which typically include:

#### 1. Collection of Information

Financial institutions must collect the following information from customers:

- **Name**: The full legal name of the individual or entity.
- **Date of Birth**: For individuals, the date of birth is required.
- **Address**: A residential or business street address for individuals, or a principal place of business for entities.
- **Identification Number**: For U.S. persons, a taxpayer identification number (TIN) is required. For non-U.S. persons, a passport number and country of issuance, or other government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence, is acceptable.

#### 2. Verification of Information

The verification process involves confirming the identity of the customer using documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination of both.

##### Document Verification

Acceptable documents for verifying identity include:

- **For Individuals**:
  - Government-issued identification such as a driver's license or passport.
  - Social Security card (in conjunction with other documents).
- **For Entities**:
  - Certified articles of incorporation.
  - Government-issued business license.
  - Partnership agreement or trust instrument.

##### Non-Documentary Verification

In cases where documents are not available or sufficient, non-documentary methods may be used, such as:

- Contacting the customer.
- Independently verifying the customer's identity through public databases.
- Checking references with other financial institutions.

#### 3. Risk-Based Approach

CIP procedures should be risk-based, meaning that the level of verification should correspond to the risk level of the customer. High-risk customers, such as those from jurisdictions with weak AML controls, may require enhanced due diligence.

### Recordkeeping Requirements

Financial institutions must maintain records of the information obtained and the methods used to verify identity. These records should include:

- **Copies of Documents**: Copies of any documents relied upon for verification.
- **Description of Non-Documentary Methods**: A description of the non-documentary methods used.
- **Resolution of Discrepancies**: Documentation of how any discrepancies in identity verification were resolved.

### Customer Notification

Customers must be informed that their identity is being verified. This can be done through written notice or orally, and should include:

- The purpose of the verification.
- The requirement to provide identifying information.
- Assurance of confidentiality and data protection.

### Examples of CIP Policies

To illustrate how CIP policies are implemented, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1: Individual Account Opening

A new customer, John Doe, wishes to open a brokerage account. The broker-dealer collects John's full name, date of birth, residential address, and Social Security number. John provides his driver's license as a form of identification. The broker-dealer verifies the information by checking the driver's license against public records and confirms John's identity.

#### Example 2: Corporate Account Opening

XYZ Corporation, a newly formed company, seeks to open a trading account. The broker-dealer collects the company's name, principal place of business, and taxpayer identification number. The corporation provides its articles of incorporation and a government-issued business license. The broker-dealer verifies the documents and conducts a non-documentary check through a business verification service to confirm the legitimacy of XYZ Corporation.

### Common Challenges and Best Practices

#### Challenges

- **Inconsistent Documentation**: Customers may provide inconsistent or outdated documents, complicating verification.
- **Non-U.S. Customers**: Verifying the identity of non-U.S. customers can be challenging due to differences in documentation standards.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Customers may be hesitant to provide personal information due to privacy concerns.

#### Best Practices

- **Use of Technology**: Implement advanced technology solutions such as biometric verification and machine learning for identity verification.
- **Training and Awareness**: Regularly train staff on CIP procedures and the importance of compliance.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring to detect changes in customer risk profiles.

### Compliance and Enforcement

Regulatory bodies such as the SEC and FINRA enforce CIP requirements. Non-compliance can result in penalties, including fines and reputational damage. Regular audits and reviews are essential to ensure adherence to CIP policies.

### Conclusion

The Customer Identification Program (CIP) is a fundamental aspect of AML compliance, critical for preventing financial crimes. By understanding and implementing effective CIP procedures, financial institutions can safeguard against money laundering and terrorist financing, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
