## 11.1.3 Company Financial Statements

Understanding company financial statements is a critical skill for anyone preparing for the Series 7 Exam. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of a company's financial health and are essential for conducting fundamental analysis. In this section, we will explore the key components of financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. We will also delve into financial ratios, which are vital tools for evaluating a company's performance and financial position.

### Key Components of Financial Statements

#### Income Statement

The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, summarizes a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period, typically a quarter or a year. It provides insight into a company's operational efficiency and profitability.

**Key Elements:**

- **Revenues:** The total income generated from the sale of goods or services. This is often referred to as the top line.
- **Expenses:** The costs incurred in the process of earning revenues. These can include cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, interest, and taxes.
- **Net Income:** Also known as the bottom line, net income is the profit remaining after all expenses have been deducted from revenues. It is a key indicator of a company's profitability.

**Example:**

Consider a company with the following annual figures:
- Revenues: $500,000
- COGS: $300,000
- Operating Expenses: $100,000
- Interest and Taxes: $50,000

**Net Income Calculation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Net Income} = \text{Revenues} - \text{COGS} - \text{Operating Expenses} - \text{Interest and Taxes}
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\text{Net Income} = \$500,000 - \$300,000 - \$100,000 - \$50,000 = \$50,000
{{< /katex >}}

#### Balance Sheet

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It is divided into three main sections: assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity.

**Key Elements:**

- **Assets:** Resources owned by the company that have economic value. Assets are typically classified into current assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable) and non-current assets (e.g., property, equipment).
- **Liabilities:** Obligations the company owes to external parties. Like assets, liabilities are divided into current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable) and long-term liabilities (e.g., bonds payable).
- **Shareholders' Equity:** The residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities. It represents the owners' claim on the company and includes common stock, retained earnings, and additional paid-in capital.

**Balance Sheet Equation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Shareholders' Equity}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

Suppose a company has:
- Total Assets: $1,000,000
- Total Liabilities: $600,000

**Shareholders' Equity Calculation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Shareholders' Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities} = \$1,000,000 - \$600,000 = \$400,000
{{< /katex >}}

#### Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement outlines the cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities. It provides insight into a company's liquidity and its ability to generate cash to fund operations and growth.

**Key Sections:**

- **Operating Activities:** Cash generated or used in the core business operations. This includes cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers and employees.
- **Investing Activities:** Cash used for or generated from investments in long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment.
- **Financing Activities:** Cash flows related to borrowing and repaying debt, issuing equity, and paying dividends.

**Example:**

Consider a company with the following cash flows:
- Net Cash from Operating Activities: $70,000
- Net Cash used in Investing Activities: $30,000
- Net Cash from Financing Activities: $20,000

**Net Change in Cash Calculation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Net Change in Cash} = \text{Net Cash from Operating Activities} + \text{Net Cash used in Investing Activities} + \text{Net Cash from Financing Activities}
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\text{Net Change in Cash} = \$70,000 - \$30,000 + \$20,000 = \$60,000
{{< /katex >}}

### Financial Ratios

Financial ratios are essential tools for analyzing a company's financial health and performance. They provide insights into profitability, liquidity, and leverage.

#### Profitability Ratios

**Return on Equity (ROE):**

ROE measures a company's ability to generate profits from its shareholders' equity.

{{< katex >}}
\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If a company has a net income of $50,000 and shareholders' equity of $400,000, the ROE is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{ROE} = \frac{\$50,000}{\$400,000} = 12.5\%
{{< /katex >}}

#### Liquidity Ratios

**Current Ratio:**

The current ratio assesses a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its short-term assets.

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If a company has current assets of $200,000 and current liabilities of $100,000, the current ratio is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\$200,000}{\$100,000} = 2.0
{{< /katex >}}

#### Leverage Ratios

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**

This ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.

{{< katex >}}
\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}
{{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

For a company with total liabilities of $600,000 and shareholders' equity of $400,000, the debt-to-equity ratio is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\$600,000}{\$400,000} = 1.5
{{< /katex >}}

### Glossary

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Net income divided by the number of outstanding shares. It indicates the profitability of a company on a per-share basis.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** A measure of a company's financial leverage calculated by dividing total liabilities by shareholders' equity.

### Practice Exercises

To reinforce your understanding, analyze the following sample company's financial statements and calculate the specified financial ratios.

**Sample Company Financials:**

- **Income Statement:**
  - Revenues: $800,000
  - COGS: $500,000
  - Operating Expenses: $150,000
  - Interest and Taxes: $70,000

- **Balance Sheet:**
  - Current Assets: $300,000
  - Non-Current Assets: $700,000
  - Current Liabilities: $200,000
  - Long-Term Liabilities: $400,000
  - Shareholders' Equity: $400,000

**Exercises:**

1. Calculate the net income.
2. Determine the current ratio.
3. Compute the ROE.
4. Find the debt-to-equity ratio.

**Solutions:**

1. **Net Income Calculation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Net Income} = \text{Revenues} - \text{COGS} - \text{Operating Expenses} - \text{Interest and Taxes}
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\text{Net Income} = \$800,000 - \$500,000 - \$150,000 - \$70,000 = \$80,000
{{< /katex >}}

2. **Current Ratio Calculation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{\$300,000}{\$200,000} = 1.5
{{< /katex >}}

3. **ROE Calculation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} = \frac{\$80,000}{\$400,000} = 20\%
{{< /katex >}}

4. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio Calculation:**

{{< katex >}}
\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} = \frac{\$600,000}{\$400,000} = 1.5
{{< /katex >}}
