## 13.3 Non-Qualified Plans

As you prepare for the Series 7 Exam, understanding the nuances of non-qualified plans is crucial. These plans offer unique benefits, particularly for high earners, and differ significantly from qualified plans in terms of regulatory oversight and tax implications. This section will delve into the specifics of non-qualified plans, their benefits, and the considerations that come with them.

### Understanding Non-Qualified Plans

Non-qualified plans are retirement savings vehicles that do not meet the requirements set by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Unlike qualified plans, non-qualified plans do not offer the same level of tax deferral and protection. However, they provide flexibility in terms of contribution limits and plan design, making them attractive to certain employers and employees.

#### Key Features of Non-Qualified Plans

- **Flexibility in Contributions:** Non-qualified plans allow employers to offer benefits to select employees without adhering to the non-discrimination rules that apply to qualified plans. This means that contributions can be tailored to reward key executives or high earners within an organization.
  
- **Tax Treatment:** Contributions to non-qualified plans are typically made with after-tax dollars, and the earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. This is in contrast to qualified plans, where contributions are often tax-deductible.

- **Lack of ERISA Protection:** Non-qualified plans do not fall under ERISA, which means they lack the protection and oversight that ERISA provides. This includes the absence of fiduciary responsibilities and the lack of a federal guarantee on plan benefits.

### Benefits for High Earners

Non-qualified plans are particularly beneficial for high earners who have already maximized their contributions to qualified plans. These plans offer an additional avenue for retirement savings and can be structured to provide substantial benefits.

#### Advantages for High Earners

1. **Supplemental Retirement Income:** Non-qualified plans can supplement qualified plan benefits, allowing high earners to save more for retirement beyond the limits imposed on qualified plans.

2. **Deferred Compensation:** Many non-qualified plans are structured as deferred compensation arrangements, enabling high earners to defer a portion of their salary or bonuses until retirement or another specified date, potentially reducing their current tax liability.

3. **Customizable Benefits:** Employers can design non-qualified plans to meet the specific needs of high earners, including offering benefits tied to performance metrics or other incentives.

4. **Retention and Attraction Tool:** For employers, offering a non-qualified plan can be a powerful tool for attracting and retaining top talent, as these plans can be tailored to provide significant financial incentives.

### Types of Non-Qualified Plans

Non-qualified plans come in various forms, each with its own set of rules and benefits. Understanding these different types is essential for navigating the complexities of retirement planning.

#### Deferred Compensation Plans

Deferred compensation plans allow employees to defer a portion of their income to a future date, typically retirement. These plans can be structured to provide tax advantages by delaying income recognition.

- **Salary Reduction Arrangements:** Employees elect to defer a portion of their salary, reducing their current taxable income. The deferred amount is invested and grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.

- **Bonus Deferral Plans:** Similar to salary reduction arrangements, employees can defer bonuses, which are then invested and grow tax-deferred.

#### Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs)

SERPs are designed specifically for executives and key employees. These plans provide additional retirement benefits beyond those available through qualified plans.

- **Employer Contributions:** Unlike deferred compensation plans, SERPs often involve employer contributions, which can be contingent on performance or tenure.

- **Vesting Schedules:** SERPs typically have vesting schedules that encourage executives to remain with the company for a specified period.

#### Executive Bonus Plans

Executive bonus plans are a form of non-qualified plan funded by the employer, who pays a bonus to the executive. The executive then uses this bonus to purchase a life insurance policy or other investment vehicle.

- **Tax Implications:** The bonus is taxable to the executive as income, but the policy's cash value grows tax-deferred.

- **Flexibility:** Executives have control over the policy and can access its cash value for retirement or other needs.

### Regulatory Considerations

While non-qualified plans offer flexibility, they also come with regulatory considerations that must be understood and managed.

#### Section 409A Compliance

Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code imposes strict rules on non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Non-compliance can result in significant tax penalties for the employee, including immediate taxation of deferred amounts and additional penalties.

- **Timing of Elections:** Employees must make deferral elections before the beginning of the tax year in which the services are performed.

- **Distribution Rules:** Distributions from non-qualified plans must meet specific requirements regarding timing and form, such as retirement, death, disability, or a change in control.

#### Taxation of Benefits

The taxation of non-qualified plan benefits is a critical consideration. Unlike qualified plans, where contributions may be tax-deductible, non-qualified plan contributions are typically made with after-tax dollars.

- **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Earnings on contributions grow tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

- **FICA Taxes:** Unlike qualified plans, contributions to non-qualified plans are subject to FICA taxes at the time of deferral.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To better understand how non-qualified plans operate in practice, consider the following examples:

#### Case Study 1: Deferred Compensation Plan for a High-Earning Executive

John, a high-earning executive at a tech company, participates in a deferred compensation plan. He elects to defer 20% of his annual bonus, which is invested in a diversified portfolio. The deferred amount grows tax-deferred, and John plans to withdraw it upon retirement, potentially at a lower tax rate.

#### Case Study 2: SERP for Retention of Key Talent

A manufacturing company offers a SERP to its top executives, providing additional retirement benefits contingent on performance and tenure. This plan is designed to retain key talent by incentivizing executives to remain with the company until retirement.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When dealing with non-qualified plans, it's essential to adhere to best practices and be aware of common pitfalls.

#### Best Practices

- **Plan Design:** Work with legal and financial advisors to design a plan that meets the specific needs of the organization and its key employees.

- **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with Section 409A and other relevant regulations to avoid tax penalties.

- **Communication:** Clearly communicate the plan's benefits, risks, and requirements to participants to ensure they understand their obligations and potential benefits.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Failure to Comply with Section 409A:** Non-compliance can lead to severe tax consequences, including immediate taxation and penalties.

- **Inadequate Documentation:** Proper documentation is essential to demonstrate compliance and support the plan's tax treatment.

- **Overlooking FICA Taxes:** Ensure that FICA taxes are paid at the time of deferral to avoid unexpected tax liabilities.

### Conclusion

Non-qualified plans offer significant benefits, particularly for high earners, by providing additional retirement savings opportunities beyond the limits of qualified plans. However, they also come with unique regulatory and tax considerations that must be carefully managed. By understanding the intricacies of non-qualified plans, you can better navigate the complexities of retirement planning and effectively prepare for the Series 7 Exam.
