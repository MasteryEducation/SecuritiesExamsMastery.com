## 13.2.4 Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE)

The Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) is a retirement savings plan designed specifically for small businesses with 100 or fewer employees. SIMPLE plans offer a streamlined and cost-effective way for small employers to provide retirement benefits to their employees. There are two primary types of SIMPLE plans: SIMPLE IRA and SIMPLE 401(k). Each has its own set of rules, contribution limits, and benefits. This section will provide a detailed exploration of both SIMPLE IRA and SIMPLE 401(k) plans, including the requirements for employee and employer contributions, guidelines for setting up these plans, and practical examples to illustrate their application.

### Understanding SIMPLE IRA and SIMPLE 401(k) Plans

#### SIMPLE IRA Plans

A SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees Individual Retirement Account) is a retirement plan that allows employees and employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees. It is an attractive option for small businesses due to its simplicity and minimal administrative costs.

- **Eligibility**: Employers with 100 or fewer employees who earned at least $5,000 in the previous year can establish a SIMPLE IRA plan. Employees who have earned at least $5,000 in any two preceding years and are expected to earn at least $5,000 in the current year are eligible to participate.

- **Contributions**:
  - **Employee Contributions**: Employees can contribute a percentage of their salary to the SIMPLE IRA, up to a maximum limit set by the IRS ($15,500 for 2024, with a catch-up contribution of $3,500 for employees aged 50 or older).
  - **Employer Contributions**: Employers are required to make either a matching contribution of up to 3% of the employee’s compensation or a non-elective contribution of 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of whether the employee contributes.

- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a SIMPLE IRA are tax-deductible for the employer, and employee contributions are made on a pre-tax basis, reducing taxable income.

- **Withdrawal Rules**: Withdrawals from a SIMPLE IRA are subject to income tax, and early withdrawals (before age 59½) may incur a penalty. Notably, the penalty for early withdrawal within the first two years of participation is 25%.

#### SIMPLE 401(k) Plans

A SIMPLE 401(k) plan is another option for small employers, combining features of a traditional 401(k) with the simplicity of a SIMPLE IRA.

- **Eligibility**: Similar to SIMPLE IRAs, SIMPLE 401(k) plans are available to employers with 100 or fewer employees who earned at least $5,000 in the previous year.

- **Contributions**:
  - **Employee Contributions**: Employees can defer a portion of their salary into the SIMPLE 401(k), up to the same limits as the SIMPLE IRA.
  - **Employer Contributions**: Employers must either match employee contributions up to 3% of their compensation or make a non-elective contribution of 2% of compensation for all eligible employees.

- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deductible, and employee deferrals reduce taxable income.

- **Vesting and Withdrawals**: SIMPLE 401(k) plans have immediate vesting, meaning employees own all contributions right away. Withdrawals are subject to similar tax and penalty rules as SIMPLE IRAs.

### Setting Up SIMPLE Plans

#### Steps to Establish a SIMPLE IRA

1. **Choose a Financial Institution**: The employer selects a financial institution to serve as the trustee of the SIMPLE IRA plan. This institution will manage the accounts, hold the plan’s assets, and provide regular account statements.

2. **Create a Written Agreement**: The employer must draft a written agreement to provide benefits to all eligible employees. This can be done using IRS Form 5304-SIMPLE or Form 5305-SIMPLE, depending on whether employees will choose their own financial institutions or if the employer will designate one.

3. **Notify Employees**: Employers are required to notify employees about the SIMPLE IRA plan, including details about the plan and the opportunity to make salary reduction contributions. This notification must be provided at least 60 days before the start of the plan year.

4. **Set Up Employee Accounts**: Each eligible employee must establish a SIMPLE IRA account to receive contributions. This can be facilitated through the chosen financial institution.

#### Steps to Establish a SIMPLE 401(k)

1. **Adopt a Plan Document**: Employers must adopt a written plan document that outlines the terms and conditions of the SIMPLE 401(k) plan. This document serves as the foundation of the plan and must comply with IRS regulations.

2. **Select a Trustee or Custodian**: Similar to SIMPLE IRAs, a trustee or custodian must be selected to manage plan assets and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

3. **Provide Employee Notices**: Employers must inform employees about the plan’s features, including contribution limits and employer matching details, at least 60 days before the plan year begins.

4. **Establish Employee Accounts**: Employees must set up individual accounts within the SIMPLE 401(k) plan to receive contributions.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To better understand how SIMPLE plans work in practice, consider the following scenarios:

**Example 1: SIMPLE IRA in a Small Business**

ABC Corp, a small marketing firm with 50 employees, decides to offer a SIMPLE IRA to enhance employee benefits. They choose a local bank as the financial institution to manage the plan. Each employee can contribute up to $15,500 annually, with the option for those over 50 to contribute an additional $3,500. ABC Corp opts for a 3% matching contribution. If an employee earns $50,000 annually and contributes 5% of their salary, the employee will contribute $2,500, and ABC Corp will match $1,500.

**Example 2: SIMPLE 401(k) for a Growing Tech Startup**

XYZ Tech, a startup with 80 employees, implements a SIMPLE 401(k) to attract and retain talent. They adopt a plan document and select a national brokerage firm as the custodian. Employees can defer up to $15,500 of their salary, with a 3% employer match. An employee earning $60,000 who contributes 6% will defer $3,600, with XYZ Tech matching $1,800.

### Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

- **Annual Filing**: SIMPLE IRA plans do not require annual filing with the IRS, while SIMPLE 401(k) plans must file Form 5500 annually.
- **Plan Amendments**: Employers can amend SIMPLE plans, but changes must comply with IRS rules and be communicated to employees.
- **Termination**: Employers can terminate SIMPLE plans by notifying employees and following IRS procedures.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: SIMPLE plans are easy to set up and administer, making them ideal for small businesses.
- **Cost-Effective**: Lower administrative costs compared to traditional 401(k) plans.
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce taxable income for both employers and employees.

#### Disadvantages

- **Contribution Limits**: Lower contribution limits compared to other retirement plans like traditional 401(k)s.
- **Mandatory Contributions**: Employers are required to make contributions, which can be a financial burden.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Fewer investment options compared to other plans.

### Best Practices for Employers

- **Evaluate Business Needs**: Consider the company’s financial situation and employee demographics when choosing between SIMPLE IRA and SIMPLE 401(k).
- **Communicate Clearly**: Ensure employees understand the benefits and requirements of participating in the plan.
- **Review Annually**: Regularly review the plan’s performance and compliance with IRS regulations.

### Conclusion

SIMPLE plans offer a valuable retirement savings option for small businesses, providing tax advantages and encouraging employee savings. By understanding the nuances of SIMPLE IRA and SIMPLE 401(k) plans, employers can make informed decisions that benefit both the company and its employees.
