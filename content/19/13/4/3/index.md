## 13.4.3 ABLE Accounts

Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Accounts are specialized savings accounts designed to support individuals with disabilities. These accounts offer tax advantages similar to those found in 529 college savings plans and are intended to help individuals with disabilities and their families save for disability-related expenses without jeopardizing eligibility for essential government benefits. Understanding ABLE Accounts is crucial for anyone preparing for the Series 7 Exam, as they represent a significant aspect of financial planning for individuals with disabilities.

### Understanding ABLE Accounts

ABLE Accounts were established under the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, commonly known as the ABLE Act. This legislation was a groundbreaking step in providing financial security for individuals with disabilities, allowing them to save for qualified disability expenses in a tax-advantaged account.

#### Key Features of ABLE Accounts

- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to an ABLE Account are made with after-tax dollars, but the earnings grow tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified disability expenses.
- **Impact on Benefits**: Funds in an ABLE Account do not affect eligibility for federal benefits such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), up to certain limits.
- **Flexibility**: ABLE Accounts can be used for a wide range of expenses related to the beneficiary's disability, providing flexibility and financial support.

### Eligibility Criteria

To open an ABLE Account, certain eligibility requirements must be met:

1. **Disability Onset**: The individual must have been diagnosed with a significant disability before the age of 26. This requirement ensures that the account is used to support individuals whose disabilities have a substantial impact on their lives from an early age.

2. **Severity of Disability**: The individual must meet the Social Security Administration's definition of disability, which includes criteria for both physical and mental impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities.

3. **Certification**: A licensed physician must certify the disability, ensuring that the individual meets the necessary criteria for opening an ABLE Account.

### Contribution Limits

The contribution limits for ABLE Accounts are designed to provide significant savings opportunities while maintaining eligibility for government benefits:

- **Annual Contribution Limit**: As of 2023, the total annual contributions to an ABLE Account from all sources (including family, friends, and the beneficiary) cannot exceed the federal gift tax exclusion amount, which is $17,000.

- **Lifetime Contribution Limit**: The total value of an ABLE Account cannot exceed the state limit for 529 plans, which varies by state but often exceeds $300,000. However, balances above $100,000 may affect SSI benefits.

- **Additional Contributions**: Beneficiaries who are employed can contribute additional funds beyond the annual limit, up to the lesser of their compensation for the year or the federal poverty line for a one-person household.

### Qualified Disability Expenses

Funds from an ABLE Account can be used for a broad range of expenses that relate to the beneficiary's disability and enhance their quality of life. These qualified disability expenses include:

- **Education**: Tuition, books, supplies, and other educational expenses.
- **Housing**: Rent, mortgage payments, utilities, and property taxes.
- **Transportation**: Costs associated with transportation, including the purchase of a vehicle or modifications to accommodate the beneficiary's disability.
- **Health and Wellness**: Medical care, therapies, and health-related expenses.
- **Assistive Technology**: Devices and services that assist the beneficiary in daily living.
- **Personal Support Services**: Services that provide personal care and assistance.
- **Employment Training and Support**: Expenses related to gaining and maintaining employment.
- **Legal Fees**: Costs for legal services related to the beneficiary's disability.

### Case Study: Maximizing the Benefits of an ABLE Account

Consider the case of Sarah, a 24-year-old with a developmental disability. Sarah's parents opened an ABLE Account for her after learning about the tax advantages and the ability to save for her future needs without affecting her SSI benefits. They contribute the maximum allowed each year and utilize the funds for Sarah's education and transportation expenses, ensuring she has the resources needed to pursue her goals.

Sarah's case illustrates the strategic use of ABLE Accounts to enhance financial security and independence for individuals with disabilities. By understanding the eligibility criteria, contribution limits, and qualified expenses, families can effectively plan for the future while maintaining access to essential government benefits.

### Regulatory Considerations

Understanding the regulatory framework surrounding ABLE Accounts is essential for financial professionals:

- **State-Specific Programs**: ABLE Accounts are administered at the state level, and each state may have specific rules and features. It is important to review the details of the state program where the account is opened.

- **Reporting Requirements**: Beneficiaries and their families must keep detailed records of contributions and withdrawals to ensure compliance with IRS regulations and to verify that funds are used for qualified expenses.

- **Impact on Benefits**: While ABLE Accounts are designed to protect eligibility for federal benefits, it is crucial to monitor account balances and understand the thresholds that may affect benefits like SSI.

### Practical Tips for Managing ABLE Accounts

- **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to maximize the tax advantages and ensure consistent savings.
- **Expense Tracking**: Maintain detailed records of all expenses paid from the ABLE Account to facilitate compliance and reporting.
- **Review State Programs**: Compare different state programs to find the one that best meets the beneficiary's needs, considering factors like fees, investment options, and additional features.

### Conclusion

ABLE Accounts offer a powerful tool for individuals with disabilities and their families to save for the future while maintaining access to essential benefits. By understanding the eligibility criteria, contribution limits, and qualified expenses, you can effectively incorporate ABLE Accounts into a comprehensive financial plan. As you prepare for the Series 7 Exam, focus on the regulatory aspects and practical applications of ABLE Accounts to ensure a thorough understanding of this important financial instrument.
