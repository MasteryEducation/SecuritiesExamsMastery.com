## 15.2 Financial Ratios and Metrics

Financial ratios and metrics are essential tools in the arsenal of any securities professional. They provide a quantitative analysis of a company's financial health, performance, and operational efficiency. Understanding these ratios is crucial for anyone preparing for the Series 7 Exam, as they form the backbone of company analysis and investment decision-making.

### Introduction to Financial Ratios

Financial ratios are mathematical comparisons of financial statement accounts or categories. These ratios are used to gauge a company's performance, financial health, and operational efficiency. They provide insights into various aspects of a business, such as liquidity, profitability, leverage, and efficiency.

#### Importance of Financial Ratios

- **Performance Evaluation**: Ratios help in assessing how well a company is performing compared to its past performance and its peers.
- **Financial Health Assessment**: They offer insights into a company's ability to meet its short-term and long-term obligations.
- **Investment Decision-Making**: Investors and analysts use ratios to make informed decisions about buying, holding, or selling securities.
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing a company's ratios with industry averages or competitors provides a context for evaluating its performance.

### Types of Financial Ratios

Financial ratios can be broadly categorized into several types, each serving a different purpose:

1. **Liquidity Ratios**: Measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.
2. **Profitability Ratios**: Assess a company's ability to generate earnings relative to sales, assets, and equity.
3. **Leverage Ratios**: Indicate the level of a company's debt relative to its assets or equity.
4. **Efficiency Ratios**: Evaluate how effectively a company uses its assets and manages its operations.
5. **Market Value Ratios**: Provide insights into the company's stock valuation.

### Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios are crucial for assessing a company's capacity to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. Key liquidity ratios include:

#### Current Ratio

The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A current ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, suggesting good liquidity.
- **Example**: A company with $200,000 in current assets and $150,000 in current liabilities has a current ratio of 1.33.

#### Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)

The quick ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity, excluding inventory from current assets. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher quick ratio indicates better liquidity without relying on inventory sales.
- **Example**: If a company has $150,000 in current assets, $50,000 in inventory, and $100,000 in current liabilities, the quick ratio is 1.0.

### Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate profits from its operations. Key profitability ratios include:

#### Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher gross profit margin indicates efficient production and cost management.
- **Example**: A company with $500,000 in revenue and $300,000 in COGS has a gross profit margin of 40%.

#### Operating Profit Margin

Operating profit margin assesses the percentage of revenue left after covering operating expenses. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Operating Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher operating profit margin suggests effective cost control and operational efficiency.
- **Example**: If a company has $100,000 in operating income and $400,000 in revenue, the operating profit margin is 25%.

#### Net Profit Margin

Net profit margin measures the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher net profit margin indicates better overall profitability.
- **Example**: A company with $50,000 in net income and $500,000 in revenue has a net profit margin of 10%.

### Leverage Ratios

Leverage ratios assess the level of a company's debt relative to its equity or assets. Key leverage ratios include:

#### Debt-to-Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity ratio compares a company's total debt to its shareholders' equity. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ratio indicates more leverage and financial risk.
- **Example**: A company with $300,000 in total debt and $200,000 in equity has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5.

#### Interest Coverage Ratio

The interest coverage ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest on its debt. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ratio suggests better ability to meet interest obligations.
- **Example**: If a company has $100,000 in EBIT and $20,000 in interest expense, the interest coverage ratio is 5.

### Efficiency Ratios

Efficiency ratios evaluate how well a company uses its assets and manages its operations. Key efficiency ratios include:

#### Asset Turnover Ratio

The asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Total Assets}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ratio indicates better asset utilization.
- **Example**: A company with $500,000 in revenue and $250,000 in average total assets has an asset turnover ratio of 2.

#### Inventory Turnover Ratio

The inventory turnover ratio assesses how quickly a company sells its inventory. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher ratio indicates efficient inventory management.
- **Example**: If a company has $300,000 in COGS and $50,000 in average inventory, the inventory turnover ratio is 6.

### Market Value Ratios

Market value ratios provide insights into a company's stock valuation and are important for investors. Key market value ratios include:

#### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The P/E ratio compares a company's share price to its earnings per share (EPS). It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share}} {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher P/E ratio may indicate higher growth expectations.
- **Example**: A company with a share price of $50 and EPS of $5 has a P/E ratio of 10.

#### Dividend Yield

Dividend yield measures the return on investment from dividends. It is calculated as:

{{< katex >}} \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \times 100 {{< /katex >}}

- **Interpretation**: A higher yield indicates better returns from dividends.
- **Example**: If a company pays $2 in annual dividends and has a share price of $40, the dividend yield is 5%.
