## 16.5.1 Reviewing Transactions

In the world of securities trading, the accurate and timely review of transactions is crucial for maintaining market integrity, ensuring compliance with regulations, and protecting client interests. As a General Securities Representative, your ability to effectively review transactions will not only help you pass the Series 7 Exam but also prepare you for a successful career in the securities industry. This section will guide you through the essential procedures for reviewing trades, identifying potential red flags, and escalating concerns when necessary.

### Establishing Procedures for Regular Review of Trades

The foundation of effective transaction review lies in establishing robust procedures that ensure all trades are scrutinized regularly. These procedures should be designed to detect any irregularities, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and maintain the trust of clients and stakeholders.

#### 1. **Developing a Trade Review Framework**

A well-structured trade review framework is essential for systematically examining transactions. This framework should include:

- **Daily Transaction Reports:** Generate daily reports that list all executed trades. This allows for prompt identification of unusual patterns or discrepancies.
- **Automated Surveillance Systems:** Utilize technology to automate the monitoring process. These systems can flag potential issues such as wash trades, spoofing, or layering.
- **Manual Oversight:** While automation is crucial, human oversight is necessary to interpret complex scenarios and exercise judgment.

#### 2. **Setting Review Frequency and Priorities**

Not all transactions require the same level of scrutiny. Establish review frequencies based on the risk profile of the transactions:

- **High-Risk Transactions:** Review daily. These include trades involving large volumes, illiquid securities, or those executed in volatile markets.
- **Moderate-Risk Transactions:** Review weekly. These might include trades in commonly traded securities or smaller volumes.
- **Low-Risk Transactions:** Review monthly. These include routine transactions with established clients and low-risk securities.

#### 3. **Documenting Review Processes**

Maintain comprehensive records of the review process, including:

- **Review Logs:** Document the date, time, and outcome of each review.
- **Audit Trails:** Ensure all changes and actions taken during the review are traceable.
- **Compliance Reports:** Generate periodic reports to demonstrate adherence to internal policies and regulatory requirements.

### Identifying Red Flags in Transaction Reviews

Detecting red flags is a critical component of transaction review. These indicators can signal potential misconduct or compliance issues that require further investigation.

#### 1. **Excessive Trading (Churning)**

Excessive trading, or churning, occurs when a broker engages in unnecessary buying and selling of securities to generate commissions. Key indicators include:

- **High Turnover Rates:** Frequent buying and selling of securities in a client's account.
- **Disproportionate Commissions:** Commissions that are unusually high relative to the account's size and objectives.

#### 2. **Unauthorized Transactions**

Unauthorized transactions occur when trades are executed without the client's consent. Red flags include:

- **Client Complaints:** Reports from clients about trades they did not authorize.
- **Discrepancies in Trade Confirmations:** Mismatches between client records and trade confirmations.

#### 3. **Market Manipulation**

Market manipulation involves practices that distort securities prices or trading volumes. Watch for:

- **Wash Trades:** Simultaneous buying and selling of the same security to create misleading activity.
- **Spoofing and Layering:** Placing orders with the intent to cancel them before execution to manipulate prices.

#### 4. **Insider Trading**

Insider trading involves trading based on non-public, material information. Indicators include:

- **Unusual Trading Activity:** Sudden spikes in trading volume or price movements before a major announcement.
- **Connections to Insiders:** Trades executed by individuals with known connections to company insiders.

### Guidelines for Escalating Concerns

When red flags are identified, it is crucial to have clear guidelines for escalating concerns to ensure timely and appropriate action.

#### 1. **Internal Escalation Procedures**

Establish a hierarchy for reporting concerns within the organization:

- **Immediate Supervisor:** Report initial concerns to your direct supervisor for preliminary assessment.
- **Compliance Department:** Escalate significant issues to the compliance department for further investigation.
- **Legal Counsel:** In cases involving potential legal violations, involve legal counsel to assess the implications.

#### 2. **Regulatory Reporting Obligations**

Certain issues may require reporting to regulatory authorities:

- **FINRA Reporting:** Report suspicious activities that violate FINRA rules.
- **SEC Filings:** In cases of significant market manipulation or insider trading, filings with the SEC may be necessary.

#### 3. **Documentation and Follow-Up**

Maintain detailed records of all escalations and follow-ups:

- **Incident Reports:** Document the nature of the concern, actions taken, and outcomes.
- **Follow-Up Reviews:** Conduct follow-up reviews to ensure issues have been resolved and preventive measures are in place.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To illustrate the transaction review process, consider the following scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Excessive Trading in a Client's Account

A broker notices that a client's account has an unusually high turnover rate, with frequent buying and selling of stocks. Upon review, the broker discovers that the commissions generated are significantly higher than the account's average balance warrants. The broker escalates the concern to the compliance department, which investigates and finds that the trading activity does not align with the client's investment objectives. As a result, the broker is counseled on ethical trading practices, and the client is compensated for any undue losses.

#### Scenario 2: Unauthorized Transactions Detected

A client contacts their brokerage firm, claiming they received a trade confirmation for a stock purchase they did not authorize. The broker reviews the account activity and finds discrepancies between the client's instructions and the executed trades. The issue is escalated to the compliance department, which conducts an investigation and determines that an administrative error led to the unauthorized transaction. The client is refunded, and the firm implements additional verification steps to prevent future occurrences.

#### Scenario 3: Suspicious Market Activity

An analyst notices a sudden surge in trading volume for a small-cap stock ahead of a major acquisition announcement. The analyst reviews the trading records and identifies several accounts with connections to the acquiring company's executives. The concern is escalated to the legal department, which works with regulatory authorities to investigate potential insider trading. As a result, the individuals involved face legal action, and the firm enhances its monitoring systems to detect similar activities in the future.

### Real-World Applications and Compliance Considerations

Understanding the real-world implications of transaction review is crucial for ensuring compliance and maintaining market integrity.

#### 1. **Adapting to Regulatory Changes**

Stay informed about changes in regulations that impact transaction review processes:

- **FINRA Rule 3110:** This rule requires firms to establish and maintain a system to supervise the activities of its associated persons that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.
- **SEC Rule 17a-4:** This rule mandates the retention of records related to securities transactions, ensuring that firms maintain comprehensive documentation of their review processes.

#### 2. **Implementing Best Practices**

Adopt industry best practices to enhance transaction review effectiveness:

- **Continuous Training:** Provide ongoing training for staff to ensure they are aware of the latest regulations and review techniques.
- **Cross-Department Collaboration:** Foster collaboration between compliance, legal, and trading departments to ensure a holistic approach to transaction review.

#### 3. **Leveraging Technology**

Utilize technology to streamline the transaction review process:

- **Data Analytics Tools:** Implement data analytics to identify patterns and trends that may indicate irregularities.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Use machine learning to enhance the accuracy of automated surveillance systems.

### Conclusion

Reviewing transactions is a critical responsibility for securities professionals, ensuring compliance with regulations and protecting client interests. By establishing robust review procedures, identifying red flags, and escalating concerns appropriately, you can contribute to the integrity and transparency of the securities market. As you prepare for the Series 7 Exam, remember that mastering these skills will not only help you succeed on the exam but also in your future career as a General Securities Representative.
