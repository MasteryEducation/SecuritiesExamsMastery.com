## 7.1 Options Basics

Options are a fascinating and versatile component of the financial markets, offering investors and traders the ability to speculate, hedge, and enhance portfolio returns. Understanding options is crucial for anyone preparing for the Series 7 exam, as they form a significant part of the curriculum and are a vital tool for securities representatives. In this section, we will delve into the basics of options, focusing on the fundamental concepts of calls and puts, the roles of option buyers and sellers, and practical examples to illustrate these concepts.

### Introduction to Options

Options are derivative securities, meaning their value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, such as stocks, indices, or commodities. An option is a contract that provides the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price, known as the strike price, on or before a specified expiration date. This flexibility makes options a powerful tool for managing risk and leveraging positions in the financial markets.

#### Key Terms and Definitions

- **Option:** A financial contract that grants the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specified price before a certain date.
- **Derivative:** A financial instrument whose value is based on the value of another asset.
- **Strike Price:** The price at which the option holder can buy or sell the underlying asset.
- **Expiration Date:** The date by which the option must be exercised or it becomes worthless.

#### Types of Options

1. **Call Options:** A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price before the expiration date. Investors purchase call options when they anticipate that the price of the underlying asset will rise.

2. **Put Options:** A put option provides the holder with the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price before the expiration date. Investors buy put options when they expect the price of the underlying asset to decline.

### Understanding Calls and Puts

Options can be thought of as insurance policies for your investments. Just as you might buy insurance to protect against unforeseen events, options can protect against adverse price movements in the market.

#### Call Options in Detail

A call option is a bullish investment strategy. When you buy a call option, you are betting that the price of the underlying asset will increase above the strike price before the option expires. If the market price of the asset exceeds the strike price, the option is said to be "in the money," and the holder can exercise the option to buy the asset at the lower strike price, potentially selling it at the higher market price for a profit.

**Example:** Suppose you purchase a call option for ABC Corporation stock with a strike price of $50 and an expiration date in three months. If ABC's stock price rises to $60 before the option expires, you can exercise the option to buy the stock at $50 and sell it at the market price of $60, earning a profit of $10 per share (minus the cost of the option).

#### Put Options in Detail

A put option is a bearish investment strategy. When you buy a put option, you are anticipating that the price of the underlying asset will fall below the strike price before the option expires. If the market price of the asset drops below the strike price, the option is "in the money," and the holder can exercise the option to sell the asset at the higher strike price, potentially buying it back at the lower market price for a profit.

**Example:** Consider purchasing a put option for XYZ Corporation stock with a strike price of $40 and an expiration date in two months. If XYZ's stock price falls to $30 before the option expires, you can exercise the option to sell the stock at $40 and buy it back at the market price of $30, earning a profit of $10 per share (minus the cost of the option).

### Roles of Option Buyers and Sellers

In the options market, there are two primary participants: option buyers (holders) and option sellers (writers). Each plays a distinct role with different rights and obligations.

#### Option Buyers (Holders)

Option buyers are the individuals or entities that purchase options contracts. They pay a premium to the option seller for the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at the strike price. Buyers have the following characteristics:

- **Rights:** Buyers have the right to exercise the option if it is advantageous to do so. They are not obligated to exercise the option if it is not profitable.
- **Risk:** The maximum risk for option buyers is limited to the premium paid for the option. If the option expires worthless, the buyer loses only the premium.
- **Profit Potential:** Call option buyers benefit from rising prices, while put option buyers profit from falling prices.

#### Option Sellers (Writers)

Option sellers, also known as writers, are the individuals or entities that sell options contracts. They receive a premium from the option buyer and are obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract if the buyer exercises the option. Sellers have the following characteristics:

- **Obligations:** Sellers are obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset if the option is exercised by the buyer.
- **Risk:** The risk for option sellers can be substantial. Call option sellers face unlimited risk if the asset's price rises significantly, while put option sellers risk loss if the asset's price falls sharply.
- **Profit Potential:** Sellers profit from the premium received from the buyer. If the option expires worthless, the seller retains the entire premium as profit.

### Practical Examples of Option Transactions

Understanding options through practical examples can help solidify your comprehension of these complex financial instruments.

#### Example 1: Buying a Call Option

Imagine you are bullish on DEF Corporation and believe its stock price will rise. You purchase a call option with a strike price of $100, paying a premium of $5 per share. The option expires in three months.

- **Scenario 1:** If DEF's stock price rises to $120 before expiration, you can exercise the option to buy the stock at $100 and sell it at $120, making a profit of $15 per share ($20 gain minus $5 premium).
- **Scenario 2:** If DEF's stock price remains at $100 or falls below, you may choose not to exercise the option, losing the $5 premium.

#### Example 2: Selling a Put Option

Suppose you are neutral to bullish on GHI Corporation and decide to sell a put option with a strike price of $50, receiving a premium of $3 per share. The option expires in two months.

- **Scenario 1:** If GHI's stock price stays above $50, the option expires worthless, and you keep the $3 premium as profit.
- **Scenario 2:** If GHI's stock price falls to $40, the option buyer may exercise the option, obligating you to buy the stock at $50, resulting in a $7 loss per share ($10 loss minus $3 premium).
