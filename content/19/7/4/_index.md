## 7.4 Basic Options Strategies

Options trading is a versatile and dynamic component of the securities market, offering investors the ability to leverage their positions, hedge against risk, and capitalize on market movements. In this section, we will explore foundational strategies for trading options, focusing on four primary approaches: Long Calls, Long Puts, Covered Calls, and Protective Puts. Each strategy will be explained in detail, including when to use it based on market expectations, potential profit, and associated risks. This knowledge is crucial for the Series 7 Exam and for practical application in the securities industry.

### Understanding Options Basics

Before delving into specific strategies, it's essential to understand the basic terminology and mechanics of options:

- **Call Option:** A contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified quantity of an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) before a specified expiration date.
- **Put Option:** A contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified quantity of an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a specified expiration date.
- **Premium:** The price paid for purchasing an option, which is determined by factors such as the underlying asset's price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and interest rates.

### 7.4.1 Long Call Strategy

#### What is a Long Call?

A Long Call strategy involves purchasing a call option with the expectation that the underlying asset's price will rise above the strike price before the option expires. This strategy is bullish, meaning it anticipates an upward movement in the asset's price.

#### When to Use a Long Call

- **Bullish Market Expectation:** Use a Long Call when you anticipate a significant increase in the price of the underlying asset.
- **Limited Capital:** If you want to leverage your investment with limited capital, buying a call option can provide exposure to the asset's price movement without the need to purchase the asset outright.

#### Profit Potential and Risk

- **Profit Potential:** The profit is theoretically unlimited, as the asset's price can rise indefinitely. The breakeven point is the strike price plus the premium paid.
- **Risk:** The maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the option.

#### Example Scenario

Suppose you purchase a call option for Company XYZ with a strike price of $50, expiring in three months. You pay a premium of $3 per share. If the stock price rises to $60, you can exercise the option, buy the stock at $50, and sell it at the market price, realizing a profit.

#### Strategy Table: Long Call

| **Parameter**        | **Details**                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Market Outlook**   | Bullish                               |
| **Profit Potential** | Unlimited                             |
| **Risk**             | Limited to premium paid               |
| **Breakeven Point**  | Strike Price + Premium                |

### 7.4.2 Long Put Strategy

#### What is a Long Put?

A Long Put strategy involves purchasing a put option with the expectation that the underlying asset's price will fall below the strike price before the option expires. This strategy is bearish, meaning it anticipates a downward movement in the asset's price.

#### When to Use a Long Put

- **Bearish Market Expectation:** Use a Long Put when you expect the price of the underlying asset to decrease significantly.
- **Hedging:** Protect an existing long position in the underlying asset by buying a put option to mitigate potential losses.

#### Profit Potential and Risk

- **Profit Potential:** The maximum profit is realized if the asset's price falls to zero, equal to the strike price minus the premium paid.
- **Risk:** The maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the option.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine you own shares of Company ABC, currently trading at $40. You anticipate a decline in the stock price and purchase a put option with a strike price of $35, paying a premium of $2 per share. If the stock price drops to $30, you can exercise the option and sell the stock at $35, mitigating your losses.

#### Strategy Table: Long Put

| **Parameter**        | **Details**                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Market Outlook**   | Bearish                               |
| **Profit Potential** | Strike Price - Premium                |
| **Risk**             | Limited to premium paid               |
| **Breakeven Point**  | Strike Price - Premium                |

### 7.4.3 Covered Call Strategy

#### What is a Covered Call?

A Covered Call strategy involves owning the underlying asset and selling a call option on the same asset. This strategy generates additional income from the premium received for selling the call option.

#### When to Use a Covered Call

- **Neutral to Slightly Bullish Market Expectation:** Use a Covered Call when you expect the underlying asset's price to remain stable or rise slightly.
- **Income Generation:** Enhance returns on an existing long position by collecting premiums from selling call options.

#### Profit Potential and Risk

- **Profit Potential:** Limited to the premium received plus any appreciation in the asset's price up to the strike price.
- **Risk:** The risk is equivalent to owning the asset, offset by the premium received.

#### Example Scenario

Assume you own 100 shares of Company DEF, currently trading at $45 per share. You sell a call option with a strike price of $50, receiving a premium of $2 per share. If the stock price remains below $50, the option expires worthless, and you keep the premium. If the stock price exceeds $50, you sell the shares at the strike price, realizing a profit.

#### Strategy Table: Covered Call

| **Parameter**        | **Details**                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Market Outlook**   | Neutral to Slightly Bullish           |
| **Profit Potential** | Premium + (Strike Price - Purchase Price) |
| **Risk**             | Equivalent to owning the asset, offset by premium received |
| **Breakeven Point**  | Purchase Price - Premium              |

### 7.4.4 Protective Put Strategy

#### What is a Protective Put?

A Protective Put strategy involves owning the underlying asset and purchasing a put option on the same asset. This strategy provides downside protection while allowing for potential upside gains in the asset's price.

#### When to Use a Protective Put

- **Bullish but Cautious Market Expectation:** Use a Protective Put when you expect the asset's price to rise but want to protect against potential declines.
- **Hedging:** Protect an existing long position against adverse price movements.

#### Profit Potential and Risk

- **Profit Potential:** Unlimited, as the asset's price can rise indefinitely, minus the premium paid for the put option.
- **Risk:** Limited to the premium paid, as the put option provides a floor for potential losses.

#### Example Scenario

Suppose you own shares of Company GHI, currently trading at $55. You purchase a put option with a strike price of $50, paying a premium of $3 per share. If the stock price falls to $45, you can exercise the option and sell the shares at $50, minimizing your losses.

#### Strategy Table: Protective Put

| **Parameter**        | **Details**                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Market Outlook**   | Bullish but Cautious                  |
| **Profit Potential** | Unlimited, minus premium paid         |
| **Risk**             | Limited to premium paid               |
| **Breakeven Point**  | Purchase Price + Premium              |

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: Long Call in a Bull Market

- **Scenario:** An investor anticipates a bullish trend in the technology sector and buys a call option for a leading tech company.
- **Outcome:** The stock price surges due to positive earnings reports, allowing the investor to exercise the option and realize substantial profits.

#### Case Study 2: Long Put for Hedging

- **Scenario:** A portfolio manager holds a significant position in a retail stock and anticipates potential market volatility.
- **Outcome:** The manager buys put options as insurance, which pays off when the stock price declines due to unfavorable retail sales data.

#### Case Study 3: Covered Call for Income

- **Scenario:** An investor seeks to generate additional income from a stable utility stock.
- **Outcome:** The investor sells call options, collecting premiums while the stock price remains relatively unchanged.

#### Case Study 4: Protective Put for Downside Protection

- **Scenario:** An investor holds shares in a pharmaceutical company facing regulatory uncertainty.
- **Outcome:** The investor buys protective puts, which mitigate losses when the company's stock price drops following regulatory setbacks.

### Regulatory Considerations

When engaging in options trading, it's crucial to comply with regulatory requirements and understand the risks involved. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversee options markets, ensuring transparency and protecting investors. Key regulations include:

- **Options Disclosure Document (ODD):** Provides essential information about options trading, including risks and strategies.
- **Customer Suitability and Approval:** Brokers must assess the suitability of options trading for individual investors based on their financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.
- **Supervision and Compliance:** Firms must establish supervisory procedures to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and protect investor interests.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices:**
  - Conduct thorough research and analysis before implementing options strategies.
  - Diversify your options portfolio to manage risk effectively.
  - Use options as part of a broader investment strategy, not in isolation.

- **Common Pitfalls:**
  - Overleveraging positions, leading to significant losses.
  - Failing to understand the complexities and risks associated with options trading.
  - Ignoring market conditions and trends when selecting options strategies.

### Conclusion
