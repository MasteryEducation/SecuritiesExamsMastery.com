## 3.1 Common Stock

### Introduction

Common stock represents an essential component of the financial markets and a cornerstone of investment portfolios. As a security that signifies ownership in a corporation, common stockholders are entitled to a share of the company's profits and assets. Understanding common stock is crucial for aspiring General Securities Representatives, as it forms a significant part of the Series 7 Exam.

This section will delve into the characteristics of common stock, explore shareholder rights, discuss the potential for capital appreciation and income, and highlight the risks associated with investing in common stock. By the end of this guide, you will have a thorough understanding of common stock, equipping you with the knowledge needed to excel in the Series 7 Exam and succeed in the securities industry.

### Defining Common Stock

**Common Stock** is a type of security that represents ownership in a corporation. Holders of common stock are equity owners of the company and have voting rights, typically one vote per share, to elect the board of directors and approve significant corporate policies. Common stockholders are entitled to dividends, which are distributions of a company's earnings, although these are not guaranteed and can fluctuate based on the company's profitability and discretion of the board.

#### Characteristics of Common Stock

1. **Ownership and Control**: Common stockholders are the true owners of a corporation. They have a residual claim on the company's assets and earnings, meaning they are paid after debt holders and preferred stockholders in the event of liquidation.

2. **Voting Rights**: Common stockholders typically have voting rights that allow them to influence corporate policy and management decisions. Votes are usually cast at annual general meetings (AGMs) or special meetings.

3. **Dividends**: While not guaranteed, dividends can be paid to common stockholders as a share of the company's profits. The frequency and amount of dividends are determined by the company's board of directors.

4. **Potential for Capital Appreciation**: Common stockholders benefit from the potential increase in the stock's market value, providing opportunities for capital gains.

5. **Limited Liability**: Common stockholders have limited liability, meaning they can only lose the amount they invested in the stock, protecting personal assets from corporate debts.

### Shareholder Rights

Common stockholders enjoy several rights that are essential for protecting their interests and influencing the company's direction.

#### Voting Rights

One of the primary rights of common stockholders is the ability to vote on important corporate matters. This includes electing the board of directors, approving mergers and acquisitions, and making decisions on significant corporate changes. Voting can be conducted in person at shareholder meetings or by proxy, allowing stockholders to delegate their voting power.

**Example**: In a corporation with 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, a stockholder owning 10,000 shares would have 1% of the total voting power.

#### Dividend Rights

Common stockholders have the right to receive dividends when declared by the board of directors. Dividends are typically paid in cash, but they can also be issued as additional shares of stock (stock dividends). The decision to pay dividends depends on the company's profitability, growth plans, and cash flow needs.

**Example**: A company declares a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. A stockholder with 1,000 shares would receive $500 in dividend payments.

#### Preemptive Rights

Preemptive rights allow existing shareholders to maintain their proportional ownership in the company when new shares are issued. This right enables stockholders to purchase additional shares before they are offered to the public, preventing dilution of their ownership stake.

**Example**: If a company issues 100,000 new shares, a stockholder with 10,000 shares may have the right to purchase 1,000 of the new shares to maintain their 1% ownership.

### Potential for Capital Appreciation and Income

Investing in common stock offers the dual potential for capital appreciation and income generation.

#### Capital Appreciation

Capital appreciation occurs when the market price of a stock increases over time. This can result from the company's growth, improved financial performance, or favorable market conditions. Investors aim to buy stocks at a lower price and sell them at a higher price, realizing a profit.

**Example**: An investor purchases shares of a technology company at $50 per share. Over three years, the stock price rises to $100 per share, resulting in a 100% capital gain.

#### Income Generation

In addition to capital appreciation, common stock can provide income through dividends. Companies with stable earnings and cash flows often distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends. Dividend-paying stocks are attractive to investors seeking regular income.

**Example**: A utility company with consistent earnings pays an annual dividend of $3 per share. An investor holding 500 shares would receive $1,500 in annual dividend income.

### Risks Associated with Investing in Common Stock

While common stock offers significant potential rewards, it also carries inherent risks that investors must consider.

#### Market Risk

Market risk refers to the potential for stock prices to fluctuate due to changes in market conditions, economic factors, or geopolitical events. Stock prices can be volatile, and investors may experience significant losses if the market declines.

**Example**: During a market downturn, a stock that was purchased at $100 per share may fall to $70 per share, resulting in a 30% loss.

#### Business Risk

Business risk arises from the possibility that a company's performance may decline due to poor management, competitive pressures, or unfavorable industry trends. This can lead to reduced earnings and lower stock prices.

**Example**: A retail company faces declining sales due to increased competition from online retailers, resulting in a drop in its stock price.

#### Dividend Risk

Dividend risk involves the potential for a company to reduce or eliminate its dividend payments. This can occur if the company faces financial difficulties or decides to reinvest earnings into growth initiatives.

**Example**: A company experiencing declining profits may cut its dividend from $2 per share to $1 per share, reducing the income for shareholders.

#### Inflation Risk

Inflation risk is the possibility that the purchasing power of future cash flows from dividends or capital gains will be eroded by rising prices. Inflation can reduce the real return on investment in common stock.

**Example**: An investor receives a 3% dividend yield, but inflation rises to 4%, resulting in a negative real return.

### Real-World Examples of Common Stock Performance

To illustrate the potential outcomes of investing in common stock, let's examine real-world examples of stock performance.

#### Example 1: Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Apple Inc. is a well-known technology company that has delivered substantial returns to its shareholders. Over the past decade, Apple's stock price has experienced significant capital appreciation due to its innovative products, strong brand, and robust financial performance. Investors who purchased Apple stock in 2010 at around $30 per share have seen the stock price rise to over $150 per share by 2023, representing a fivefold increase.

#### Example 2: General Electric (GE)

General Electric, once a dominant industrial conglomerate, faced challenges in recent years due to strategic missteps and industry changes. As a result, GE's stock price declined significantly, illustrating the business risk associated with common stock. Investors who held GE stock during this period experienced substantial losses as the company's financial performance deteriorated.

### Conclusion

Understanding common stock is fundamental for anyone pursuing a career in the securities industry. As a General Securities Representative, you will encounter common stock in various contexts, from advising clients to analyzing investment opportunities. By mastering the characteristics, rights, potential rewards, and risks of common stock, you will be well-prepared for the Series 7 Exam and equipped to make informed decisions in your professional practice.
