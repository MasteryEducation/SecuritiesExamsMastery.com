## 3.2 Preferred Stock

Preferred stock is a unique class of equity security that combines elements of both stocks and bonds. It offers investors certain advantages over common stock, primarily in terms of dividend payments and claim on assets. Understanding preferred stock is crucial for aspiring General Securities Representatives, as it plays a significant role in portfolio diversification and income strategies.

### Definition and Features of Preferred Stock

**Preferred Stock** is a class of ownership in a corporation that has a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stock. Preferred shares typically come with a fixed dividend that must be paid out before dividends to common shareholders. This feature makes preferred stock similar to bonds, providing a more predictable income stream.

#### Key Features of Preferred Stock

1. **Dividend Preference**: Preferred shareholders receive dividends before common shareholders. These dividends are usually fixed and can be cumulative, meaning if a company skips a dividend payment, it must pay the missed dividends to preferred shareholders before any dividends can be paid to common shareholders.

2. **Priority in Liquidation**: In the event of liquidation, preferred shareholders have a higher claim on assets than common shareholders, though they are subordinate to debt holders.

3. **Lack of Voting Rights**: Typically, preferred shareholders do not have voting rights in corporate decisions, unlike common shareholders. However, some preferred shares may grant voting rights under specific conditions, such as when dividends are in arrears.

4. **Callable Feature**: Many preferred stocks are callable, meaning the issuing company can redeem them at a predetermined price after a certain date. This feature allows companies to refinance if interest rates drop.

5. **Convertible Option**: Some preferred stocks are convertible into a specified number of common shares, offering potential for capital appreciation.

### Dividend Preference Over Common Stock

The most significant advantage of preferred stock is its dividend preference. Preferred dividends are generally fixed and must be paid before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders. This makes preferred stock an attractive option for investors seeking stable income.

#### Cumulative vs. Non-Cumulative Dividends

- **Cumulative Preferred Stock**: If a company cannot pay dividends, cumulative preferred stockholders are entitled to receive missed payments in the future before any dividends are paid to common shareholders.
  
- **Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock**: If dividends are missed, non-cumulative preferred stockholders do not have the right to claim these missed payments in the future.

### Types of Preferred Stock and Their Characteristics

Preferred stock can be categorized into several types, each with unique features and benefits. Understanding these variations is essential for making informed investment decisions.

#### 3.2.1 Types of Preferred Stock

##### 3.2.1.1 Cumulative Preferred Stock

- **Characteristics**: Guarantees payment of missed dividends in the future.
- **Investor Appeal**: Attractive to risk-averse investors seeking reliable income.

##### 3.2.1.2 Convertible Preferred Stock

- **Characteristics**: Offers the option to convert preferred shares into a predetermined number of common shares.
- **Investor Appeal**: Provides potential for capital appreciation if the company's common stock performs well.

##### 3.2.1.3 Participating Preferred Stock

- **Characteristics**: Allows shareholders to receive additional dividends if the company achieves certain financial goals.
- **Investor Appeal**: Offers potential for higher income based on company performance.

##### 3.2.1.4 Callable Preferred Stock

- **Characteristics**: Can be redeemed by the issuing company at a specified price after a certain date.
- **Investor Appeal**: Often comes with a higher dividend yield to compensate for the call risk.

##### 3.2.1.5 Perpetual Preferred Stock

- **Characteristics**: Does not have a maturity date, providing indefinite dividend payments.
- **Investor Appeal**: Suitable for long-term income-focused investors.

##### 3.2.1.6 Adjustable-Rate Preferred Stock

- **Characteristics**: Dividends are tied to a benchmark interest rate, such as the LIBOR or Treasury rate.
- **Investor Appeal**: Offers protection against interest rate fluctuations.

### Comparison Between Preferred and Common Stock

Understanding the differences between preferred and common stock is crucial for evaluating investment opportunities and risks.

#### Dividend Payments

- **Preferred Stock**: Offers fixed dividends with priority over common stock.
- **Common Stock**: Dividends are variable and paid after preferred dividends.

#### Voting Rights

- **Preferred Stock**: Generally lacks voting rights.
- **Common Stock**: Typically includes voting rights on major corporate decisions.

#### Claim on Assets

- **Preferred Stock**: Higher claim on assets in liquidation compared to common stock.
- **Common Stock**: Residual claim after debts and preferred dividends are paid.

#### Price Volatility

- **Preferred Stock**: Generally less volatile due to fixed dividends and priority in claims.
- **Common Stock**: More volatile, with potential for higher capital gains.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To illustrate the concepts discussed, consider the following scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Dividend Payment**

A company has both common and cumulative preferred stock. Due to financial difficulties, it skips dividend payments for two years. Once the company recovers, it must pay all missed dividends to cumulative preferred shareholders before any dividends can be paid to common shareholders.

**Scenario 2: Convertible Preferred Stock**

An investor holds convertible preferred shares in a tech company. As the company's common stock price rises significantly, the investor exercises the conversion option, exchanging preferred shares for common shares to capitalize on the stock's appreciation.

### Real-World Applications and Regulatory Considerations

Preferred stock is a versatile investment vehicle used by corporations to raise capital while maintaining control, as preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights. It's essential for securities representatives to understand the regulatory environment surrounding preferred stock, including:

- **Securities Act of 1933**: Governs the issuance of preferred stock, requiring registration and disclosure to protect investors.
- **FINRA Rules**: Ensure fair dealing and suitability when recommending preferred stock to clients.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Diversification**: Include a mix of preferred and common stock in portfolios to balance income and growth potential.
- **Due Diligence**: Analyze the issuing company's financial health and dividend history before investing in preferred stock.
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Consider the impact of interest rate changes on preferred stock prices, especially for fixed-rate issues.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Call Risk**: Callable preferred stock may be redeemed by the issuer, potentially limiting income if interest rates fall.
- **Overlooking Credit Risk**: Preferred stock is subject to credit risk, as dividends depend on the issuer's financial stability.

### Conclusion

Preferred stock offers a unique blend of equity and fixed-income characteristics, making it an essential component of diversified investment portfolios. By understanding the various types of preferred stock, their features, and the associated risks, you can make informed decisions that align with your investment objectives and risk tolerance.

- Types of preferred stock include cumulative, convertible, participating, callable, perpetual, and adjustable-rate.
