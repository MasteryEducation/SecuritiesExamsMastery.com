## 20.4.2 Filing with FINRA

As an aspiring General Securities Representative, understanding the process of filing communications with FINRA's Advertising Regulation Department is crucial for both your Series 7 Exam preparation and your future career in the securities industry. This section provides a comprehensive guide to the filing requirements, procedures, and best practices to ensure compliance and avoid common pitfalls.

### Overview of FINRA Filing Requirements

FINRA, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, requires certain types of communications to be filed with its Advertising Regulation Department to ensure they comply with regulatory standards. These communications include retail communications, which are intended for more than 25 retail investors within any 30 calendar-day period, and certain types of institutional communications that may require filing under specific circumstances.

#### Types of Communications Subject to Filing

1. **Retail Communications**: These include advertisements, sales literature, and other promotional materials distributed to retail investors. Examples include brochures, websites, and social media posts.

2. **Institutional Communications**: Generally exempt from filing unless they pertain to products with specific filing requirements, such as mutual funds or variable insurance products.

3. **Public Appearances**: While not typically filed, scripts or materials used in public appearances may need to be submitted if they are used as retail communications.

4. **Correspondence**: Usually exempt unless it is used in a manner that qualifies as a retail communication.

### When to File with FINRA

The timing of filing communications with FINRA is critical. Communications must be filed either prior to first use or within a specific timeframe after first use, depending on the type of communication and the firm's status.

#### Pre-Use Filing Requirements

- **New Member Firms**: Firms in their first year of FINRA membership must file retail communications at least 10 business days prior to first use.
- **Certain Products**: Retail communications concerning registered investment companies (mutual funds), variable insurance products, direct participation programs, and collateralized mortgage obligations must be filed at least 10 business days prior to first use.

#### Post-Use Filing Requirements

- **Established Member Firms**: Retail communications not subject to pre-use filing must be filed within 10 business days of first use.
- **Amendments and Updates**: Any significant changes to previously filed communications must be re-filed within 10 business days of first use.

### How to File with FINRA

Filing communications with FINRA involves several procedural steps, typically conducted through FINRA's online filing system, the Advertising Regulation Electronic Files (AREF) system.

#### Step-by-Step Filing Process

1. **Prepare the Communication**: Ensure the content complies with FINRA's advertising rules, focusing on fair and balanced presentation, clear risk disclosure, and avoidance of misleading statements.

2. **Access the AREF System**: Log into FINRA's AREF system using your firm's credentials.

3. **Upload the Communication**: Submit the communication along with any supporting materials, such as backup documentation or disclosures.

4. **Complete the Filing Form**: Provide detailed information about the communication, including its intended audience, purpose, and any related products.

5. **Submit the Filing**: Once all information is complete, submit the filing for FINRA's review.

6. **Monitor the Filing Status**: Check the AREF system regularly for updates on the status of your filing.

#### Common Filing Mistakes to Avoid

- **Incomplete Disclosures**: Ensure all necessary risk disclosures are included and prominently displayed.
- **Misleading Claims**: Avoid exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims about products or services.
- **Inaccurate Information**: Double-check all data and statistics for accuracy and relevance.

### Review Outcomes and Compliance

Once a communication is filed, FINRA's Advertising Regulation Department will review it for compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The review process can result in several outcomes:

#### Potential Review Outcomes

1. **Approval**: The communication complies with FINRA rules and can be used as filed.

2. **Conditional Approval**: The communication is approved with conditions, such as required modifications or additional disclosures.

3. **Denial**: The communication does not comply and must be revised before use.

4. **Request for Additional Information**: FINRA may request further documentation or clarification to complete the review.

#### Responding to FINRA Feedback

- **Make Required Changes**: If modifications are needed, revise the communication promptly and resubmit it for review.
- **Provide Additional Information**: Submit any requested documentation or clarification to facilitate the review process.
- **Maintain Records**: Keep detailed records of all communications, filings, and FINRA correspondence for compliance purposes.

### Timelines and Procedural Steps

Understanding the timelines and procedural steps involved in filing with FINRA is crucial for maintaining compliance and avoiding delays.

#### Filing Timelines

- **Pre-Use Filing**: At least 10 business days prior to first use for certain communications and new member firms.
- **Post-Use Filing**: Within 10 business days of first use for other retail communications.

#### Procedural Steps

1. **Preparation**: Develop and review the communication for compliance.
2. **Filing**: Submit the communication through the AREF system.
3. **Review**: Monitor the review process and respond to any feedback from FINRA.
4. **Implementation**: Once approved, implement the communication as part of your marketing strategy.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the filing process with FINRA, consider the following scenarios:

#### Example 1: New Member Firm Filing

A new member firm is preparing a brochure for a new mutual fund offering. As a new firm, they must file the brochure with FINRA at least 10 business days before its planned distribution. The firm prepares the brochure, ensuring all risk disclosures are included, and submits it through the AREF system. FINRA reviews the filing and provides conditional approval, requiring additional disclosures about the fund's past performance. The firm makes the necessary changes and resubmits the brochure, receiving final approval for distribution.

#### Example 2: Established Firm Post-Use Filing

An established firm launches a new social media campaign promoting a variable annuity product. The campaign materials are filed with FINRA within 10 business days of first use. During the review, FINRA requests clarification on the annuity's fee structure. The firm provides the requested information, and the campaign is approved without further modifications.

### Best Practices for Filing with FINRA

To ensure a smooth filing process and maintain compliance, consider the following best practices:

- **Stay Informed**: Regularly review FINRA's advertising rules and updates to ensure your communications remain compliant.
- **Use Clear and Accurate Language**: Avoid jargon and ensure all claims are substantiated with reliable data.
- **Include Comprehensive Disclosures**: Clearly disclose all risks and fees associated with the products or services being promoted.
- **Maintain Detailed Records**: Keep thorough records of all communications, filings, and FINRA feedback for future reference.

### Common Pitfalls and Strategies to Overcome Them

Navigating the FINRA filing process can present challenges, but understanding common pitfalls and strategies to overcome them can help you succeed.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Inadequate Disclosures**: Failing to include necessary risk disclosures can lead to delays or denials.
