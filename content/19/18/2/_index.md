## 18.2 The Securities Exchange Act of 1934

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is a cornerstone of U.S. financial regulation, often referred to as the "People Act" due to its focus on protecting investors in the secondary market. This act established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a pivotal regulatory body tasked with enforcing securities laws and ensuring market integrity. Understanding the provisions and implications of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is crucial for anyone preparing for the Series 7 Exam, as it lays the foundation for numerous regulations and compliance requirements that govern the securities industry today.

### Introduction to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was enacted in response to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. Its primary purpose is to regulate the secondary trading of securities—stocks, bonds, and debentures—ensuring transparency, fairness, and efficiency in the financial markets. Unlike the Securities Act of 1933, which focuses on the initial issuance of securities, the 1934 Act addresses the trading of securities after they have been issued.

#### Key Objectives of the Act

- **Protect Investors**: By mandating accurate and timely disclosure of financial information, the act aims to protect investors from fraud and manipulation.
- **Ensure Fair Markets**: The act seeks to promote fair and orderly markets, preventing practices that could distort market prices or harm investors.
- **Maintain Market Integrity**: By regulating securities exchanges, brokers, and dealers, the act helps maintain the integrity of the financial markets.

### Creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

One of the most significant outcomes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is an independent federal agency responsible for enforcing federal securities laws and regulating the securities industry, the nation's stock and options exchanges, and other related activities and organizations.

#### Role and Responsibilities of the SEC

- **Enforcement of Securities Laws**: The SEC has the authority to enforce securities laws and take action against violators.
- **Regulation of Securities Markets**: It oversees the registration and regulation of securities exchanges, brokers, and dealers.
- **Review of Corporate Filings**: The SEC reviews corporate filings to ensure compliance with disclosure requirements.
- **Investor Education**: The SEC provides resources and information to help investors make informed decisions.

#### Structure of the SEC

The SEC is composed of five commissioners appointed by the President of the United States, with no more than three commissioners belonging to the same political party. This structure is designed to ensure a balanced and impartial approach to regulation.

### Key Provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 contains several important provisions that are critical for maintaining fair and efficient markets. These provisions cover a wide range of topics, from registration requirements to anti-fraud measures.

#### Registration and Regulation of Securities Exchanges

The act requires all securities exchanges to register with the SEC. This registration process ensures that exchanges comply with regulations designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity.

- **Exchange Registration**: Exchanges must provide detailed information about their operations, governance, and financial condition.
- **Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)**: Exchanges are considered SROs, meaning they have the authority to create and enforce their own rules, subject to SEC approval.

#### Regulation of Brokers and Dealers

Brokers and dealers play a crucial role in the securities markets, facilitating the buying and selling of securities. The 1934 Act imposes several requirements on these entities to ensure they operate fairly and transparently.

- **Material Event Disclosure**: Companies must promptly disclose material events that could affect their financial condition or stock price.

#### Proxy Solicitation Rules

- **Proxy Statements**: Companies must provide shareholders with a proxy statement containing information about the issues to be voted on.
- **Shareholder Proposals**: Shareholders have the right to submit proposals for inclusion in the company's proxy materials.
