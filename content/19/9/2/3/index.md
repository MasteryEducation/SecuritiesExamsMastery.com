## 9.2.3 Policy Loans and Withdrawals

### Introduction

Variable life insurance policies offer a unique blend of life insurance protection and investment opportunities. One of the key features of these policies is the ability to access the cash value through policy loans and withdrawals. Understanding how these mechanisms work is crucial for both policyholders and financial professionals, as they can significantly impact the policy's performance and the death benefits.

### Understanding Policy Loans

A **policy loan** is a loan taken against the cash value of a life insurance policy. Unlike traditional loans, policy loans do not require a credit check or approval process, as the cash value in the policy serves as collateral. This makes them an attractive option for policyholders in need of liquidity.

#### How Policy Loans Work

1. **Loan Amount**: Policyholders can typically borrow up to a certain percentage of the cash value, often around 90%. The exact amount available depends on the policy's terms and the accumulated cash value.

2. **Interest Rates**: Policy loans accrue interest, which can be fixed or variable. The interest rate is usually lower than that of unsecured loans, but it is crucial to understand how it is calculated and applied.

3. **Repayment**: While there is no mandatory repayment schedule, unpaid loans and accrued interest will reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit. Policyholders are encouraged to repay the loan to avoid these reductions.

#### Impact on Death Benefits and Policy Performance

Taking a policy loan reduces the cash value and the death benefit of the policy. If the loan is not repaid, the death benefit payable to beneficiaries will be reduced by the outstanding loan amount and any accrued interest. This can significantly impact the financial protection intended for beneficiaries.

**Example Calculation**:

Consider a variable life insurance policy with a cash value of $100,000 and a death benefit of $500,000. If the policyholder takes a loan of $50,000 at an interest rate of 5% per annum, the impact on the policy can be illustrated as follows:

- **Initial Loan**: $50,000
- **Interest Accrued in Year 1**: $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500
- **Outstanding Loan After Year 1**: $52,500

If the policyholder passes away after one year without repaying the loan, the death benefit would be reduced to:

- **Reduced Death Benefit**: $500,000 - $52,500 = $447,500

### Withdrawals from Variable Life Insurance

Withdrawals allow policyholders to access a portion of their policy's cash value without taking a loan. Unlike loans, withdrawals do not accrue interest, but they can have a more immediate impact on the policy's cash value and death benefit.

#### How Withdrawals Work

1. **Withdrawal Limits**: Policies often allow partial withdrawals up to a certain limit, typically not exceeding the total premiums paid into the policy.

2. **Tax Implications**: Withdrawals are generally tax-free up to the amount of premiums paid. Withdrawals exceeding this amount may be subject to income tax.

3. **Effect on Cash Value and Death Benefit**: Withdrawals reduce the cash value and, consequently, the death benefit. Unlike loans, there is no option to "repay" a withdrawal to restore the original death benefit.

#### Impact on Policy Performance

Withdrawals can affect the investment component of a variable life insurance policy. By reducing the cash value, there is less money available to invest, potentially impacting the policy's growth potential.

**Example Calculation**:

Assume a policyholder withdraws $20,000 from a policy with a cash value of $100,000 and a death benefit of $500,000. The immediate impact would be:

- **New Cash Value**: $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000
- **Reduced Death Benefit**: $500,000 - $20,000 = $480,000

### Comparing Loans and Withdrawals

While both policy loans and withdrawals provide access to the cash value, they have distinct differences:

- **Interest**: Loans accrue interest, while withdrawals do not.
- **Repayment**: Loans can be repaid to restore the death benefit, whereas withdrawals permanently reduce it.
- **Taxation**: Withdrawals may have tax implications if they exceed the premiums paid.

### Strategic Considerations

When deciding between a loan and a withdrawal, policyholders should consider their financial needs, tax situation, and long-term goals. Here are some strategic considerations:

- **Short-term Liquidity Needs**: If the need for cash is temporary, a loan might be preferable due to the option of repayment.
- **Permanent Cash Needs**: For permanent needs, a withdrawal may be more appropriate, especially if the withdrawal amount is within the tax-free limit.
- **Impact on Beneficiaries**: Consider how the reduction in death benefit will affect beneficiaries and whether alternative financial arrangements are necessary.

### Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

Policy loans and withdrawals are subject to regulatory guidelines to protect consumers. It is essential for financial professionals to adhere to these regulations and provide clear, accurate information to clients.

- **Disclosure Requirements**: Ensure clients understand the terms, interest rates, and potential impacts on their policy.
- **Suitability**: Assess whether a loan or withdrawal is suitable for the client's financial situation and objectives.

### Case Study: Balancing Immediate Needs with Long-term Goals

Consider a policyholder, Alex, who needs $30,000 for a home renovation. Alex has a variable life insurance policy with a cash value of $150,000 and a death benefit of $600,000. Alex is weighing the options between a policy loan and a withdrawal.

- **Option 1: Policy Loan**: Alex takes a $30,000 loan with a 6% interest rate. After one year, the loan amount grows to $31,800. If Alex repays the loan, the death benefit remains intact at $600,000.

- **Option 2: Withdrawal**: Alex withdraws $30,000, reducing the cash value to $120,000 and the death benefit to $570,000. This option does not incur interest but permanently reduces the death benefit.

Alex decides to take a policy loan, planning to repay it over the next two years to maintain the full death benefit for their beneficiaries.

### Best Practices for Managing Policy Loans and Withdrawals

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review the policy to assess the impact of loans or withdrawals on the cash value and death benefit.
2. **Repayment Plan**: If taking a loan, establish a repayment plan to minimize interest accrual and restore the death benefit.
3. **Tax Planning**: Consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications of withdrawals and ensure compliance with tax regulations.

### Conclusion

Policy loans and withdrawals are powerful tools within variable life insurance policies, offering flexibility and access to cash when needed. However, they come with significant implications for the policy's performance and the death benefit. By understanding these mechanisms and considering strategic, regulatory, and tax implications, policyholders and financial professionals can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals.
