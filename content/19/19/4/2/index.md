## 19.4.2 Legal Penalties and Sanctions for Insider Trading

Insider trading, the illegal practice of trading on the stock exchange to one's advantage through having access to confidential information, is a serious offense in the securities industry. It undermines market integrity and investor confidence, and thus, is met with stringent legal penalties and sanctions. This section will delve into the civil and criminal penalties associated with insider trading, the enforcement roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the impact on professional licenses and careers, and the significance of the whistleblower bounty program.

### Understanding Insider Trading

Before exploring the penalties, it is essential to understand what constitutes insider trading. Insider trading occurs when someone buys or sells a security while in possession of material nonpublic information about the security. This information is typically obtained from a position of trust and confidence, such as corporate executives, board members, or employees.

#### Material Nonpublic Information

Material information is any information that could influence an investor's decision to buy or sell securities. Nonpublic information is data that has not been disseminated to the public. When combined, material nonpublic information can give an unfair advantage in the securities markets.

### Civil Penalties for Insider Trading

Civil penalties for insider trading are primarily enforced by the SEC. The SEC can impose significant fines and sanctions on individuals and entities involved in insider trading.

#### Disgorgement of Profits

One of the primary civil penalties is the disgorgement of profits. This requires the violator to return all ill-gotten gains obtained through insider trading. The purpose of disgorgement is to deprive wrongdoers of their unlawful profits and deter future violations.

#### Civil Fines

In addition to disgorgement, the SEC can impose civil fines. Under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, the SEC can seek a civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the insider trading activity. This is known as a "treble damages" penalty.

#### Injunctions and Bars

The SEC may also seek injunctions to prevent future violations. An injunction is a court order that prohibits the violator from engaging in certain activities. Additionally, the SEC can bar individuals from serving as officers or directors of public companies.

### Criminal Penalties for Insider Trading

Criminal penalties for insider trading are enforced by the DOJ. These penalties can include substantial fines and imprisonment.

#### Fines

Individuals convicted of insider trading can face criminal fines of up to $5 million. For entities, such as corporations, the fines can be as high as $25 million. These fines are separate from any civil penalties imposed by the SEC.

#### Imprisonment

Insider trading is a felony offense, and individuals convicted can face imprisonment for up to 20 years. The length of the sentence depends on the severity of the offense and the amount of profit gained or loss avoided.

### Role of the SEC and DOJ in Enforcement

The SEC and DOJ play crucial roles in the enforcement of insider trading laws. They work together to investigate and prosecute insider trading cases.

#### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

The SEC is responsible for civil enforcement of insider trading laws. It conducts investigations, files civil lawsuits, and seeks penalties such as disgorgement, fines, and injunctions. The SEC has a dedicated division, the Division of Enforcement, which focuses on detecting and prosecuting insider trading violations.

#### Department of Justice (DOJ)

The DOJ handles the criminal prosecution of insider trading cases. It works closely with the SEC to build cases against individuals and entities suspected of insider trading. The DOJ has the authority to bring criminal charges and seek imprisonment and fines.

### Impact on Professional Licenses and Careers

Engaging in insider trading can have devastating effects on an individual's professional licenses and career prospects.

#### Loss of Licenses

Individuals found guilty of insider trading may lose their professional licenses. For example, a registered representative may lose their FINRA license, effectively ending their career in the securities industry. Other professional licenses, such as those for attorneys or accountants, may also be revoked.

#### Career Consequences

The stigma of an insider trading conviction can make it challenging to find employment in the financial industry. Many firms are reluctant to hire individuals with a history of insider trading due to the potential reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny.

### Whistleblower Bounty Program

The whistleblower bounty program is an essential tool in the fight against insider trading. It incentivizes individuals to report insider trading violations by offering monetary rewards.

#### SEC Whistleblower Program

The SEC's whistleblower program, established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, provides financial rewards to individuals who provide information leading to successful enforcement actions. Whistleblowers can receive between 10% and 30% of the monetary sanctions collected in actions where the sanctions exceed $1 million.

#### Importance of Whistleblowers

Whistleblowers play a critical role in uncovering insider trading schemes. They often have access to information that is not available to regulators, making them invaluable in detecting and prosecuting violations.

### Case Studies and Examples

To illustrate the real-world application of these penalties and sanctions, let's examine some notable insider trading cases.

#### Case Study: Raj Rajaratnam

Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group, was convicted of insider trading in 2011. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison and ordered to pay a $10 million fine. The case involved trading on insider information from corporate executives and insiders at major companies.

#### Case Study: Martha Stewart

In 2004, Martha Stewart was convicted of insider trading-related charges, including obstruction of justice and making false statements. She served five months in prison and was fined $30,000. The case highlighted the severe consequences of insider trading, even for high-profile individuals.

### Best Practices for Compliance

To avoid the severe penalties associated with insider trading, individuals and firms should implement robust compliance programs.

#### Compliance Training

Regular compliance training can help employees understand the legal and ethical obligations related to insider trading. Training should cover the identification of material nonpublic information and the consequences of insider trading.

#### Internal Controls

Firms should establish internal controls to prevent and detect insider trading. This includes monitoring trading activity, restricting access to sensitive information, and implementing policies for handling material nonpublic information.

#### Reporting Mechanisms

Encouraging employees to report suspicious activity can help firms identify and address potential insider trading violations. Anonymous reporting mechanisms, such as hotlines, can facilitate this process.

### Conclusion

Insider trading is a serious offense with significant legal penalties and sanctions. The SEC and DOJ play critical roles in enforcing insider trading laws, and individuals found guilty can face severe civil and criminal penalties. The impact on professional licenses and careers can be devastating, underscoring the importance of compliance and ethical conduct in the securities industry. The whistleblower bounty program serves as a valuable tool in detecting and prosecuting insider trading, highlighting the importance of reporting violations. By understanding the penalties and implementing best practices for compliance, individuals and firms can protect themselves from the severe consequences of insider trading.
