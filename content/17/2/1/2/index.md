## 2.1.2 Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)

Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) play a pivotal role in the governance and regulation of the securities industry. These non-governmental entities are empowered to create and enforce industry regulations and standards, ensuring that market participants adhere to ethical practices and compliance requirements. This section delves into the definition, purpose, key players, and functions of SROs, as well as their interaction with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

### Definition and Purpose of SROs

Self-Regulatory Organizations are entities that have been granted the authority to regulate their own members through the establishment and enforcement of rules and standards. Unlike government agencies, SROs operate independently, although they are subject to oversight by governmental bodies such as the SEC. The primary purpose of SROs is to maintain the integrity of the securities markets by promoting ethical practices, ensuring compliance with regulations, and protecting investors.

#### Key Objectives of SROs:

- **Promote Ethical Practices:** SROs establish codes of conduct and ethical guidelines to ensure that market participants act with integrity and fairness.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Through rulemaking and enforcement, SROs ensure that their members comply with industry regulations.
- **Protect Investors:** By implementing measures to safeguard investors' interests, SROs help maintain confidence in the securities markets.

### Key SROs in the Securities Industry

Several prominent SROs operate within the U.S. securities industry, each with specific roles and responsibilities. The most notable include the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), and securities exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ.

#### Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

FINRA is a leading SRO responsible for regulating broker-dealers and their associated persons in the United States. As an independent, non-governmental organization, FINRA is tasked with ensuring that the securities industry operates fairly and honestly.

- **Regulatory Functions:** FINRA oversees the activities of broker-dealers by developing rules and regulations that govern their conduct. It monitors compliance and takes disciplinary action against members who violate its standards.
- **Qualification Exams:** FINRA administers several qualification exams, including the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam and the Series 7 Exam, to ensure that industry professionals possess the necessary knowledge and skills.
- **Investor Protection:** FINRA implements various investor protection measures, such as the BrokerCheck tool, which allows investors to research the professional backgrounds of brokers.

#### Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)

The MSRB is an SRO that focuses on regulating the municipal securities market. It establishes rules for municipal securities dealers and advisors to promote transparency and protect investors.

- **Rulemaking Authority:** The MSRB creates rules governing the activities of municipal securities firms and professionals. These rules cover areas such as fair pricing, disclosure, and professional qualifications.
- **Enforcement:** Although the MSRB does not have enforcement authority, it relies on other agencies, such as FINRA and the SEC, to enforce its rules.
- **Market Transparency:** The MSRB operates the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system, which provides free public access to municipal securities disclosures and trade data.

#### Exchanges as SROs

Securities exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ function as SROs for their members. These exchanges are responsible for setting listing and trading standards, as well as monitoring compliance.

- **Listing Standards:** Exchanges establish criteria that companies must meet to list their securities, ensuring that listed companies adhere to financial and governance standards.
- **Trading Rules:** Exchanges develop rules governing the trading of securities, including order types, trade reporting, and market conduct.
- **Surveillance and Enforcement:** Exchanges monitor trading activities to detect and prevent fraudulent or manipulative practices.

### Functions and Responsibilities of SROs

SROs perform several critical functions to maintain the integrity and stability of the securities markets. These functions include rulemaking, enforcement, member education, and investor protection.

#### Rulemaking

SROs are responsible for developing regulations that govern the ethics, conduct, and operational activities of their member firms. These rules are designed to ensure fair and orderly markets, protect investors, and promote ethical behavior among market participants.

- **Ethical Standards:** SROs establish codes of conduct that outline the ethical obligations of their members, including honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.
- **Operational Rules:** SROs develop rules that govern the operational aspects of securities trading, such as order handling, trade reporting, and recordkeeping.

#### Enforcement

SROs monitor compliance with their rules and have the authority to initiate disciplinary actions against members who violate these standards. Enforcement actions may include fines, suspensions, or expulsion from the organization.

- **Compliance Monitoring:** SROs conduct regular examinations and audits of their members to ensure compliance with industry regulations.
- **Disciplinary Actions:** When violations are detected, SROs can impose sanctions, such as fines or suspensions, to deter future misconduct.

#### Member Education

SROs provide guidance, resources, and training to industry professionals to ensure they understand and comply with regulatory requirements. This includes offering educational programs, workshops, and online resources.

- **Training Programs:** SROs offer training programs to help industry professionals stay informed about regulatory changes and best practices.

- **Transparency Initiatives:** SROs promote market transparency by providing access to information about securities, market participants, and trading activities.

### Interaction with the SEC

While SROs operate independently, the SEC oversees their activities to ensure they act in the public interest. The SEC has the authority to approve SRO rules and can mandate changes if necessary.

- **Oversight and Approval:** The SEC reviews and approves SRO rules to ensure they comply with federal securities laws and protect investors.
- **Collaboration:** The SEC collaborates with SROs to address emerging regulatory challenges and enhance market integrity.
