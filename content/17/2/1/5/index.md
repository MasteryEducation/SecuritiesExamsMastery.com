Each participant plays a vital role in the functioning and integrity of capital markets. In this section, we will explore the key market participants, their functions, regulatory requirements, and their impact on the securities markets.

### Broker-Dealers

**Definition and Functions**

Broker-dealers are firms or individuals that engage in the business of buying and selling securities. They operate in two capacities:

- **Broker:** Acts as an agent for clients, executing buy and sell orders on their behalf.
- **Dealer:** Trades securities for their own account, profiting from the spread between the purchase and sale prices.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Facilitating Transactions:** Broker-dealers play a critical role in ensuring liquidity in the markets by matching buyers with sellers.
- **Providing Investment Advice:** Many broker-dealers offer advisory services, helping clients make informed investment decisions.
- **Underwriting Securities:** They assist issuers in bringing new securities to market, often purchasing securities from the issuer and selling them to the public.

**Regulatory Requirements**

- **Registration:** Broker-dealers must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and become members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
- **Compliance:** They must adhere to strict regulatory standards, including maintaining accurate records and ensuring fair trading practices.

**Example:** A broker-dealer might help a client purchase shares of a company by finding a seller and executing the trade on a stock exchange. They earn a commission for this service.

### Investment Advisers

Investment advisers provide advice about securities to clients for compensation. They may manage investment portfolios or offer financial planning services.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Advisory Services:** Investment advisers offer tailored advice based on clients' financial goals and risk tolerance.
- **Fiduciary Duty:** They are required to act in the best interests of their clients, prioritizing clients' needs over their own.

**Regulatory Requirements**

- **Registration:** Depending on the assets under management (AUM), investment advisers must register with the SEC (for AUM over $100 million) or state regulators.
- **Investment Advisers Act of 1940:** This act governs the registration and regulation of investment advisers, ensuring they meet fiduciary standards.

**Example:** An investment adviser might recommend a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to a client based on their risk profile and investment objectives.

### Issuers

**Definition and Functions**

Issuers are entities that develop, register, and sell securities to raise capital for operations. They can be corporations, governments, or other organizations.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Issuing Securities:** Issuers create securities such as stocks and bonds to raise funds from investors.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** They must comply with regulations, including filing registration statements and prospectuses with the SEC.

**Example:** A corporation might issue new shares of stock to finance a major expansion project, offering these shares to the public through a primary market offering.

### Underwriters

**Definition and Functions**

Underwriters are intermediaries that help issuers bring new securities to market. They play a crucial role in the initial public offering (IPO) process.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Due Diligence:** Underwriters conduct thorough investigations to ensure the issuer's financial statements are accurate and the securities are fairly priced.
- **Pricing and Distribution:** They help determine the initial price of the securities and distribute them to investors.

**Types of Underwriting Arrangements**

- **Firm Commitment:** The underwriter buys the entire issue and resells it to the public, assuming the risk of unsold securities.
- **Best Efforts:** The underwriter sells as much of the issue as possible but does not guarantee the sale of the entire issue.

**Example:** An investment bank acting as an underwriter might purchase all the shares of a company's IPO and then sell them to institutional and retail investors.

### Retail Investors

**Definition and Functions**

Retail investors are individual investors who buy and sell securities for their personal accounts. They typically invest smaller amounts compared to institutional investors.

**Impact on the Market**

- **Market Influence:** Retail investors collectively have a significant impact on market trends and liquidity.
- **Regulatory Protections:** Regulations protect retail investors from fraud and ensure they receive fair treatment in the markets.

**Example:** A retail investor might purchase shares of a mutual fund to save for retirement, benefiting from professional management and diversification.

**Roles and Responsibilities**
