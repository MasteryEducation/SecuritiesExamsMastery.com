## 2.1.1 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

### Introduction to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) serves as the cornerstone of the U.S. securities regulatory framework. Established by Congress in 1934 in the wake of the Great Depression, the SEC's primary mission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. Understanding the SEC's role is crucial for anyone entering the securities industry, as it impacts every aspect of market operations and investor interactions.

### Role and Purpose of the SEC

#### Protecting Investors

The SEC's foremost responsibility is to safeguard investors from fraudulent and manipulative practices in the securities markets. It achieves this by enforcing securities laws that ensure transparency and fairness, thereby building investor confidence.

#### Maintaining Market Integrity

The SEC works to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets by regulating key market participants, including securities exchanges, broker-dealers, and investment advisers. This regulation helps prevent market manipulation and ensures that markets function smoothly.

#### Facilitating Capital Formation

By creating a regulatory environment that promotes transparency and fairness, the SEC aids in capital formation. This involves ensuring that companies can raise funds through public offerings while providing investors with the necessary information to make informed decisions.

### Functions and Responsibilities of the SEC

#### Enforcement of Federal Securities Laws

The SEC enforces a wide range of laws designed to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Key legislation includes:

- **Securities Act of 1933**: Requires issuers of securities to register their offerings with the SEC and provide financial and other significant information.
- **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**: Regulates secondary trading of securities, establishes the SEC, and grants it authority to oversee securities exchanges and broker-dealers.

The SEC has the authority to bring civil enforcement actions against individuals and entities that violate securities laws, which can result in penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions.

#### Regulation of Securities Markets

The SEC oversees the securities markets to ensure they operate fairly and efficiently. This includes regulating:

- **Securities Exchanges**: Ensuring they comply with SEC regulations and provide transparent and fair trading environments.

#### Disclosure Requirements

The SEC mandates that public companies disclose significant financial and operational information. This includes periodic financial statements, proxy statements, and other filings that provide transparency and allow investors to make informed decisions.

#### Investor Education

The SEC plays a vital role in educating investors through resources and tools designed to help them understand investment risks and opportunities. This includes the [Investor.gov](https://www.investor.gov/) website, which offers a wealth of information on investing basics, fraud prevention, and more.

### Divisions of the SEC

The SEC is organized into several divisions, each with specific responsibilities that contribute to its overall mission:

#### Division of Corporation Finance

This division oversees corporate disclosure of important information to the investing public. It reviews filings by public companies to ensure compliance with disclosure requirements, thereby promoting transparency and informed investing.
