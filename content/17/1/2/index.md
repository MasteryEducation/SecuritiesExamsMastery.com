## 1.2 Exam Structure and Content Overview

Embarking on your journey to pass the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam requires a solid understanding of its structure and content. This section provides a detailed breakdown of the exam format, content areas, and scoring criteria, equipping you with the knowledge to approach the exam with confidence.

### Exam Format

The SIE Exam is designed to assess your foundational understanding of the securities industry. It consists of 85 multiple-choice questions, of which 75 are scored and 10 are unscored. The unscored questions are experimental and are used by FINRA to test new question formats and content. These do not impact your final score but are indistinguishable from scored questions during the exam.

You will have 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete the exam, requiring effective time management skills to ensure that you can thoughtfully address each question. This time allocation translates to approximately 74 seconds per question, making it crucial to pace yourself and avoid spending too much time on any single question.

### Content Areas

The exam content is divided into four main sections, each focusing on different aspects of the securities industry. Understanding these areas will help you allocate your study time effectively and ensure comprehensive preparation.

#### 1. Knowledge of Capital Markets (16%)

This section evaluates your understanding of the broader securities markets and the entities that regulate them. Key topics include:

#### 2. Understanding Products and Their Risks (44%)

- **Equity and Debt Securities:** Differentiate between common and preferred stocks, corporate bonds, U.S. government securities, municipal bonds, and other debt instruments.
- **Packaged Products:** Explore mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds, unit investment trusts (UITs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs).

### Scoring and Passing Criteria

To pass the SIE Exam, you must achieve a score of 70% or higher. This means you need to correctly answer at least 53 out of the 75 scored questions. The unscored questions are not included in this calculation, so focus on performing well across all content areas.

The exam is scored electronically, and you will receive your results immediately upon completion. If you do not pass, you can retake the exam after a 30-day waiting period. However, after three attempts, a 180-day waiting period is required before you can retake the exam.

### Glossary
