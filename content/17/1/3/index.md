## 1.3 Eligibility and Registration Process

The Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam is the foundational step for anyone aspiring to enter the securities industry. Understanding the eligibility criteria and the registration process is crucial for a smooth and successful exam experience. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements and steps involved in registering for the SIE Exam, ensuring you are well-prepared to embark on your journey in the securities industry.

### Eligibility Requirements

The SIE Exam is designed to assess your basic knowledge of the securities industry, and it is open to a wide range of candidates. Here are the key eligibility requirements:

- **Age Requirement:** You must be at least 18 years old to sit for the SIE Exam. This age requirement ensures that candidates have reached the legal age of majority, which is necessary for entering into binding agreements and understanding financial responsibilities.

- **No Prerequisites:** There are no formal prerequisites to take the SIE Exam. You do not need to have prior work experience in the securities industry or hold any specific educational qualifications. This openness encourages a diverse range of individuals to enter the field.

### Registration Steps

The registration process for the SIE Exam varies slightly depending on whether you are an unaffiliated individual or an associated person with a firm. Below are the detailed steps for each scenario:
