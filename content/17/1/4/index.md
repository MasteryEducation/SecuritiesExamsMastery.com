This section will guide you through the intricacies of the exam's structure, scoring process, and retake policies, ensuring you are well-equipped to tackle the SIE Exam with confidence.

### Exam Details

The SIE Exam is designed to assess your knowledge of basic securities industry information, including concepts fundamental to working in the industry, such as types of products and their risks, the structure of the securities industry markets, regulatory agencies and their functions, and prohibited practices.

If you pass, you can proceed with further licensing exams or registration with FINRA member firms. If you do not pass, the detailed score report will guide your study focus for future attempts.
