## 3.1.4 American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)

American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are a crucial component of the U.S. securities market, providing a bridge for American investors to access foreign equity markets. Understanding ADRs is essential for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam, as they represent a significant segment of international investment opportunities.

### Definition and Purpose

ADRs are negotiable certificates issued by U.S. banks, representing a specific number of shares in a foreign corporation. These receipts allow U.S. investors to buy shares in foreign companies without dealing directly with the complexities of foreign markets. By holding an ADR, an investor effectively holds the foreign company's shares but in a form that is more accessible and convenient within the U.S. financial system.

#### Key Points:
- **Issued by U.S. Banks:** ADRs are created when a U.S. bank purchases a bulk of shares from a foreign company and reissues them on a U.S. stock exchange.
- **Facilitate International Investment:** They provide a simplified means for U.S. investors to diversify their portfolios internationally.
- **Denominated in U.S. Dollars:** This feature eliminates the need for U.S. investors to deal with foreign currency transactions directly.

### Characteristics of ADRs

Understanding the characteristics of ADRs is vital for comprehending how they function within the financial markets.

#### Trading and Denomination

- **Trading Venues:** ADRs can be listed on major U.S. exchanges such as the NYSE or NASDAQ, or they can trade over-the-counter (OTC).
- **Denomination in U.S. Dollars:** ADRs are priced in U.S. dollars, and dividends are also paid in dollars, which simplifies the investment process for U.S. investors.

#### Sponsored vs. Unsponsored ADRs

- **Sponsored ADRs:** These are created with the cooperation of the foreign company. Sponsored ADRs often provide investors with voting rights and more comprehensive financial information.
- **Unsponsored ADRs:** These are established without the direct involvement of the foreign company, typically trading OTC. They may have less transparency and fewer shareholder rights.

#### Levels of ADRs

ADRs are categorized into three levels, each with different regulatory and trading characteristics:

- **Level I ADRs:** These are the simplest form, trading OTC with minimal reporting requirements. They are used primarily for establishing a trading presence in the U.S.
- **Level II ADRs:** These are listed on U.S. exchanges and must comply with SEC reporting requirements, providing more transparency and liquidity.
- **Level III ADRs:** These are used when a foreign company wishes to raise capital in the U.S. through a public offering. They require full SEC registration and disclosure, similar to U.S. companies.

### Benefits of ADRs

ADRs offer several benefits that make them attractive to U.S. investors:

- **Ease of Access:** ADRs simplify the process of investing in foreign companies by eliminating the need to navigate foreign markets and currencies.
- **Diversification:** They provide exposure to international markets, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios beyond domestic stocks.
- **Regulatory Framework:** ADRs are subject to U.S. securities regulations, offering a level of protection and transparency.

### Risks Associated with ADRs

While ADRs offer many advantages, they also come with specific risks that investors must consider:

- **Political Risk:** Changes in the political environment of the foreign country can impact the performance of the underlying shares.
- **Currency Risk:** Although ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates can affect the value of dividends and the ADR itself.
- **Regulatory Risk:** Differences in accounting standards and regulatory frameworks between the U.S. and the foreign country can pose challenges.

### ADRs and the SIE Exam

For the SIE Exam, it is important to understand how ADRs facilitate international investment and the distinctions between different types of ADRs. Key focus areas include:

- **Investment Facilitation:** Recognizing how ADRs enable U.S. investors to access foreign equities.
- **Benefits and Risks:** Understanding the advantages and potential pitfalls associated with ADRs.
- **Sponsored vs. Unsponsored ADRs:** Knowing the differences in structure, rights, and transparency.
