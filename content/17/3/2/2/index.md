## 3.2.2 U.S. Government Securities

U.S. Government Securities are debt obligations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, representing some of the safest investment options available due to their backing by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. This section will delve into the definition, characteristics, types, benefits, and risks associated with these securities, providing you with the knowledge needed to excel in the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam.

### Definition and Characteristics

U.S. Government Securities are instruments issued by the U.S. Treasury to finance government spending. These securities are considered low-risk investments because they are backed by the U.S. government, making them a staple in many investment portfolios. They are known for their liquidity, safety, and tax advantages, offering investors a secure way to preserve capital and earn a return.

### Types of Treasury Securities

The U.S. Treasury issues several types of securities, each with distinct features and maturity periods. Understanding these differences is crucial for the SIE Exam and for making informed investment decisions.

#### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

**Treasury Bills** are short-term securities that mature in one year or less. They are sold at a discount to their face value, and the interest earned is the difference between the purchase price and the amount paid at maturity. T-Bills do not pay periodic interest, making them unique among Treasury securities.

- **Maturity:** Typically 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks.
- **Interest Calculation:** The interest is the difference between the purchase price and the face value.
- **Example:** If you purchase a T-Bill for $9,800 that matures in 26 weeks with a face value of $10,000, your interest earned is $200.

#### Treasury Notes (T-Notes)

**Treasury Notes** are intermediate-term securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 10 years. They pay interest semiannually, providing a steady income stream for investors.

- **Maturity:** 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years.
- **Interest Payment:** Semiannual, fixed rate.
- **Example:** A 5-year T-Note with a 2% coupon rate will pay $20 annually on a $1,000 face value, distributed in two $10 payments.

#### Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)

**Treasury Bonds** are long-term securities with maturities of 20 or 30 years. Like T-Notes, they pay interest semiannually, making them suitable for investors seeking long-term income.

- **Maturity:** 20 or 30 years.
- **Interest Payment:** Semiannual, fixed rate.
- **Example:** A 30-year T-Bond with a 3% coupon rate will pay $30 annually on a $1,000 face value, distributed in two $15 payments.

#### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

**Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)** are designed to protect investors from inflation. The principal value of TIPS adjusts with inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). They pay interest every six months on the adjusted principal, ensuring that the real value of the investment is maintained.

- **Maturity:** 5, 10, or 30 years.
- **Principal Adjustment:** Linked to CPI.
- **Interest Payment:** Semiannual, based on adjusted principal.
- **Example:** If inflation increases by 2%, a $1,000 TIPS will adjust to $1,020, and interest will be paid on this new principal amount.

### Benefits of U.S. Government Securities

#### Safety of Principal

U.S. Government Securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, offering unparalleled security. This makes them an attractive option for risk-averse investors.

#### Liquidity

These securities are highly liquid, with active secondary markets that allow investors to buy and sell them easily. This liquidity ensures that investors can convert their holdings into cash quickly if needed.

#### Tax Advantages

Interest earned on U.S. Government Securities is exempt from state and local taxes, although it is subject to federal income tax. This tax treatment can be beneficial for investors in high-tax states.

### Risks Associated with U.S. Government Securities

#### Interest Rate Risk

The prices of U.S. Government Securities are inversely related to interest rate movements. When interest rates rise, the prices of existing bonds typically fall, and vice versa. This risk is more pronounced in longer-term securities like T-Bonds.

#### Inflation Risk

While TIPS provide protection against inflation, other Treasury securities offer fixed payments that may lose purchasing power over time due to inflation. Investors must consider this risk when choosing between fixed-rate securities and TIPS.

### U.S. Government Securities and the SIE Exam

For the SIE Exam, it is essential to understand the different types of Treasury securities, their features, and how they react to interest rate changes. You should also be familiar with the tax treatment of interest income from these securities.
