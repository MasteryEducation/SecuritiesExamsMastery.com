## 3.2.4 Agency Securities

Agency securities are a critical component of the debt securities market, often featured in the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam. Understanding these securities involves recognizing their issuers, characteristics, benefits, risks, and tax implications. This section provides a comprehensive overview to help you master the topic and excel in your exam preparation.

### Definition and Issuers

Agency securities are debt instruments issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). They play a significant role in providing liquidity to the housing market and other sectors.

#### Federal Agencies

- **Ginnie Mae (GNMA):** The Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, is a federal agency that issues mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. This backing ensures a high level of credit quality, making Ginnie Mae securities a popular choice for risk-averse investors.

#### Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)

- **Fannie Mae (FNMA):** The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, is a GSE that provides liquidity to the mortgage market by purchasing mortgages from lenders and issuing MBS. While not explicitly backed by the government, Fannie Mae is perceived to have an implicit guarantee, which bolsters investor confidence.
  
- **Freddie Mac (FHLMC):** The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, operates similarly to Fannie Mae, buying mortgages and issuing MBS. Freddie Mac's securities also benefit from an implied government backing.

- **Federal Home Loan Banks:** These banks provide liquidity to member institutions (such as banks and credit unions) to support housing finance and community investment. They issue debt securities to fund these activities.

### Characteristics

Agency securities, particularly mortgage-backed securities (MBS), have distinct features that make them attractive to investors.

#### Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

- **Structure:** MBS are bonds secured by pools of home loans. Investors in MBS receive monthly payments, which include both principal and interest. The structure of these securities allows for a steady income stream.

- **Pass-Through Securities:** In a pass-through security, the cash flows from the underlying mortgages are passed through to investors. This means investors receive monthly payments proportional to their investment in the security.

#### Credit Quality

- **Ginnie Mae:** As securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, Ginnie Mae MBS are considered highly secure with minimal credit risk.

- **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:** While not directly backed by the government, these GSEs are perceived to have an implied guarantee, providing a level of security that is slightly lower than Ginnie Mae but still robust.

### Benefits

Agency securities offer several advantages that make them appealing to investors.

#### Income

- **Monthly Payments:** The structure of MBS provides investors with regular monthly payments, which can be attractive for those seeking a steady income stream.

- **Higher Yields:** Compared to U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities often offer higher yields, compensating investors for the slightly higher risk associated with GSEs.

#### Variety

- **Different Structures:** Agency securities come in various forms, including collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), which offer different risk and return profiles to suit diverse investor preferences.

### Risks

Despite their benefits, agency securities are not without risks. Understanding these risks is crucial for making informed investment decisions and for exam preparation.

#### Prepayment Risk

- **Definition:** Prepayment risk is the risk that the underlying loans in an MBS will be paid off early, usually due to refinancing when interest rates decline. This can lead to a loss of anticipated interest income for investors.

- **Impact:** When prepayments occur, investors may have to reinvest the returned principal at lower prevailing interest rates, potentially reducing their overall returns.

#### Extension Risk

- **Definition:** Extension risk arises when borrowers slow down their payments, extending the investment period. This typically occurs when interest rates rise, making refinancing less attractive.

- **Impact:** Extended repayment periods can lock investors into lower-yielding securities when higher-yielding alternatives are available in the market.

#### Credit Risk

- **Minimal but Present:** While Ginnie Mae securities have minimal credit risk due to government backing, GSE securities carry a slight credit risk due to their implied rather than explicit guarantee.

### Tax Considerations

Understanding the tax implications of agency securities is essential for both investment decisions and exam preparation.

- **Interest Income:** The interest earned on agency securities is subject to federal and state taxes. Investors should consider these tax obligations when evaluating the net returns on their investments.

### Agency Securities and the SIE Exam

For the SIE Exam, it's important to grasp the following concepts related to agency securities:

- **Types and Features:** Be familiar with the different types of agency securities and their unique features, such as MBS and CMOs.

- **Issuers and Backing:** Recognize the issuers of agency securities and understand the level of government backing associated with each.

- **Risks:** Pay special attention to prepayment and extension risks, as these are commonly tested areas.

### Glossary

- **Agency Security:** A debt obligation issued by a federal agency or GSE.
- **Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS):** An investment backed by mortgages, providing monthly principal and interest payments to investors.
- **Prepayment Risk:** The risk that loans underlying a security are paid off early, reducing expected interest income.
- **Extension Risk:** The risk that borrowers will slow down repayments, extending the investment period and potentially reducing returns.
