## 3.8.6 Currency Risk

Currency risk, also known as exchange rate risk, is a critical consideration for investors engaging in international markets. This risk arises from the potential for loss due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between currencies when investing in foreign assets. Understanding currency risk is essential for securities professionals, as it directly impacts investment returns and strategic decision-making.

### Definition of Currency Risk

Currency risk is the uncertainty associated with changes in the exchange rate of one currency relative to another. When investors hold assets denominated in a foreign currency, they are exposed to the risk that the value of that currency will fluctuate against their home currency. These fluctuations can significantly impact the returns on international investments.

### Characteristics of Currency Risk

#### Impact on International Investments

Currency risk is particularly relevant for investments in foreign stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When an investor converts foreign investment gains back into their home currency, changes in exchange rates can either enhance or diminish returns. For example, if the foreign currency appreciates against the investor's home currency, the value of the investment increases. Conversely, if the foreign currency depreciates, the investment's value decreases.

#### Two-Way Risk

Currency risk is inherently a two-way risk. While currency appreciation can boost returns, depreciation can lead to losses. This dual nature requires investors to carefully consider the potential for both positive and negative currency movements when investing internationally.

### Factors Influencing Currency Risk

Several factors can influence currency risk, including economic indicators, political stability, and market speculation.

#### Economic Indicators

Economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth play a significant role in determining exchange rates. For instance, higher interest rates in a country can attract foreign capital, leading to an appreciation of its currency. Conversely, high inflation can erode a currency's value, leading to depreciation.

#### Political Stability

Political stability and government actions can also affect currency values. Changes in government policies, geopolitical tensions, and economic sanctions can lead to fluctuations in exchange rates. Investors must be aware of the political landscape in countries where they hold investments.

#### Market Speculation

Market speculation and investor sentiment can drive short-term currency movements. Speculators often react to news and events, causing rapid fluctuations in exchange rates. These speculative activities can create volatility in currency markets, impacting investment returns.

### Impact of Currency Risk on Investments

Currency risk affects various types of investments, including foreign stocks and bonds, global mutual funds and ETFs, and multinational companies.

#### Foreign Stocks and Bonds

Investors holding foreign stocks and bonds face currency risk as the value of these assets is affected by both the performance of the asset and currency movements. A strong performance of a foreign stock may be offset by unfavorable exchange rate changes, reducing overall returns.

#### Global Mutual Funds and ETFs

Global mutual funds and ETFs expose investors to currency risk through the fund's holdings. The value of these funds can fluctuate based on the exchange rates of the currencies in which the underlying assets are denominated. Investors must consider the currency exposure of the funds they invest in.

#### Multinational Companies

Currency fluctuations can significantly impact the earnings and stock prices of multinational companies. Companies operating in multiple countries face currency risk as they convert foreign revenues back into their home currency. This risk can affect their financial performance and, consequently, their stock valuation.

### Management Strategies for Currency Risk

Investors can employ various strategies to manage currency risk, including currency hedging, hedged investment products, and diversification.

#### Currency Hedging

Currency hedging involves using financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, or options to lock in exchange rates and mitigate currency risk. By hedging, investors can protect themselves against unfavorable currency movements, ensuring more stable returns.

**Example:**

An investor holding European stocks might use a forward contract to lock in the current exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar. This contract allows the investor to sell euros at a predetermined rate in the future, reducing the impact of potential euro depreciation.

#### Hedged Investment Products

Some investment products, such as hedged mutual funds or ETFs, employ currency hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk. These funds actively manage currency exposure, allowing investors to benefit from international diversification without the full impact of currency fluctuations.

#### Diversification

Diversification involves investing in a basket of currencies to spread risk. By holding assets in multiple currencies, investors can reduce the impact of any single currency's volatility on their overall portfolio. This strategy can be particularly effective for long-term investors seeking to balance risk and return.
