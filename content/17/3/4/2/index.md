## 3.4.2 Options Strategies

Options strategies are essential tools for investors and traders seeking to maximize returns, manage risk, and capitalize on market movements. This section provides a detailed exploration of both basic and advanced options strategies, focusing on their objectives, risks, and benefits. Understanding these strategies is crucial for success in the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam and for a career in the securities industry.

### Basic Strategies

#### Long Call

The long call strategy involves purchasing a call option, which gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a specified strike price before the option expires.

- **Objective:** Profit from an expected increase in the underlying asset's price.
- **Risk:** Limited to the premium paid for the option.
- **Reward:** Potentially unlimited if the asset's price rises significantly above the strike price.

**Example:** Suppose you buy a call option for Company XYZ with a strike price of $50, paying a premium of $2 per share. If XYZ's stock price rises to $60, you can exercise the option to buy at $50, gaining $8 per share ($10 profit minus $2 premium).

#### Long Put

The long put strategy involves buying a put option, granting the right to sell an asset at a predetermined price.

- **Objective:** Profit from an expected decrease in the underlying asset's price.
- **Risk:** Limited to the premium paid for the option.
- **Reward:** Limited to the strike price minus the premium if the asset's price falls to zero.

**Example:** You purchase a put option for ABC Corp with a strike price of $40, paying a premium of $3. If ABC's stock falls to $30, you can sell at $40, netting $7 per share ($10 profit minus $3 premium).

#### Short Call

The short call strategy involves selling a call option, expecting the asset's price to remain below the strike price.

- **Objective:** Generate income through the premium received.
- **Risk:** Potentially unlimited if the asset's price rises significantly.
- **Reward:** Limited to the premium received.

**Example:** You sell a call option on DEF Inc. with a strike price of $70, receiving a $4 premium. If DEF's stock stays below $70, you keep the premium as profit. If it rises above $70, losses can be substantial.

#### Short Put

The short put strategy entails selling a put option, anticipating the asset's price will stay above the strike price.

- **Objective:** Generate income through the premium received.
- **Risk:** Significant if the asset's price falls sharply.
- **Reward:** Limited to the premium received.

**Example:** You sell a put option on GHI Ltd. with a strike price of $30, earning a $2 premium. If GHI's stock remains above $30, you profit from the premium. A drop below $30 could result in large losses.

### Advanced Strategies

#### Protective Put

A protective put involves buying a put option to hedge against potential losses in an owned asset.

- **Objective:** Protect against downside risk while maintaining upside potential.
- **Risk:** Limited to the premium paid for the put.
- **Reward:** Unlimited if the asset's price rises, while losses are capped.

**Example:** You own 100 shares of JKL Corp, currently at $50, and purchase a put option with a $48 strike price for $2. If JKL's price falls to $40, you can sell at $48, limiting losses to $4 per share ($50 - $48 + $2 premium).

#### Covered Call

A covered call strategy involves writing a call option against owned shares to generate income with limited risk.

- **Objective:** Earn additional income from owned shares.
- **Risk:** Limited to losing potential gains above the strike price.
- **Reward:** Premium received plus any stock appreciation up to the strike price.

**Example:** You own 100 shares of MNO Inc. at $60 and sell a call option with a strike price of $65, receiving a $3 premium. If MNO rises to $70, you sell at $65, earning $8 per share ($5 gain + $3 premium).

#### Straddle

A straddle strategy involves buying or selling both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration to profit from volatility or lack thereof.

- **Objective:** Profit from significant price movement in either direction.
- **Risk:** Limited to the total premiums paid (for long straddles).
- **Reward:** Unlimited if the asset's price moves significantly.

**Example:** You buy a call and a put option on PQR Corp, both with a $50 strike price and a $5 premium. If PQR's price moves to $60 or $40, you profit from the respective option, offsetting the other premium.

#### Spread Strategies

**Vertical Spread:** Involves buying and selling options of the same type (calls or puts) with different strike prices.

- **Objective:** Limit risk and reduce cost.
- **Risk:** Limited to the net premium paid.
- **Reward:** Limited to the difference in strike prices minus the net premium.

**Example:** A bull call spread involves buying a call at a lower strike price and selling another at a higher strike price.

**Horizontal (Calendar) Spread:** Involves buying and selling options of the same type and strike price but different expirations.

- **Objective:** Profit from time decay and volatility changes.
- **Risk:** Limited to the net premium paid.
- **Reward:** Potentially significant if volatility changes favorably.

**Diagonal Spread:** Combines vertical and horizontal spreads, involving options with different strike prices and expirations.

- **Objective:** Benefit from both price movement and time decay.
- **Risk:** Limited to the net premium paid.
- **Reward:** Varies based on market conditions and strategy execution.

### Benefits of Strategies

- **Income Generation:** Collecting premiums through option writing enhances income.
- **Risk Management:** Strategies like protective puts hedge positions to limit potential losses.
- **Speculation:** Leveraging market views on asset price movements allows for strategic speculation.

### Risks of Strategies

- **Complexity:** Advanced strategies require a thorough understanding and careful execution.
- **Risk of Losses:** Potential for significant losses, especially with uncovered (naked) option writing.
- **Transaction Costs:** Multiple positions may increase fees and commissions.
- **Assignment Risk:** Obligation to fulfill the contract if assigned, especially in short positions.

### Regulatory Considerations

- **Suitability Requirements:** Brokers must ensure clients understand the risks and strategies before trading options.
- **Option Agreement Form:** Clients must sign an agreement before engaging in options trading.
- **Margin Requirements:** Certain strategies, especially those involving short positions, may require margin accounts.
