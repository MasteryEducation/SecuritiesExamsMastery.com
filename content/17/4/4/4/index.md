## 4.4.4 Unauthorized Transactions

Unauthorized transactions in securities accounts represent a significant risk both to investors and the integrity of financial markets. These transactions occur when trades or activities are executed in a customer's account without their prior knowledge or consent. Understanding the nature of unauthorized transactions, the regulatory framework governing them, and the measures to prevent them is crucial for anyone involved in the securities industry. This section provides a comprehensive overview of unauthorized transactions, including their types, regulatory requirements, consequences, and preventive measures.

### Definition of Unauthorized Transactions

Unauthorized transactions are defined as any trades or activities conducted in a customer's account without the customer's explicit prior consent. These transactions undermine the trust between clients and financial professionals and can lead to significant financial losses and legal repercussions.

### Types of Unauthorized Transactions

Unauthorized transactions can take several forms, each with distinct characteristics and implications:

- **Excessive Trading without Consent:**
  - This occurs when a broker or registered representative makes trades in a customer's account without obtaining proper authorization. Such actions can lead to churning, where excessive trading is conducted to generate commissions rather than benefit the client.

- **Discretionary Trading without Written Authorization:**
  - Discretionary trading involves executing trades on behalf of a client without needing prior approval for each transaction. However, this requires written discretionary authority from the client. Trading without this authorization violates regulatory requirements.

- **Forgery and Alteration:**
  - This involves falsifying client signatures or documents to process transactions. Forgery is a severe violation that can lead to criminal charges, in addition to regulatory penalties.

### Regulatory Requirements

The regulatory framework governing unauthorized transactions is designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Key regulations include:

- **FINRA Rule 3260:**
  - This rule prohibits discretionary trading without prior written authorization from the client and approval by the firm. It ensures that representatives do not overstep their authority and that clients' interests are protected.

- **Obligation to Obtain Consent:**
  - Registered representatives must obtain explicit consent for each transaction unless discretionary authority is granted. This requirement underscores the importance of transparency and client involvement in trading decisions.

#### FINRA Rule 3260: Discretionary Accounts

FINRA Rule 3260 is a critical regulation that governs the use of discretionary accounts. It mandates that:

1. **Written Authorization:**
   - Representatives must obtain written authorization from the client before engaging in discretionary trading. This authorization must be specific and clearly outline the scope of the representative's authority.

2. **Firm Approval:**
   - The firm must approve the discretionary account and ensure that appropriate supervisory procedures are in place to monitor the representative's activities.

3. **Ongoing Supervision:**
   - Firms are required to conduct regular reviews of discretionary accounts to ensure compliance with client instructions and regulatory requirements.

### Consequences for Violations

Violations of regulations regarding unauthorized transactions can lead to severe consequences, including:

- **Disciplinary Actions by Regulators:**
  - Regulatory bodies such as FINRA and the SEC can impose fines, suspensions, or even revoke licenses of individuals and firms found guilty of unauthorized transactions.

- **Legal Action by Clients:**
  - Clients may pursue legal action to recover damages incurred due to unauthorized transactions. This can result in significant financial liabilities for the firm and the individual involved.

- **Reputational Damage:**
  - Firms and professionals involved in unauthorized transactions risk damaging their reputation, which can lead to loss of business and trust in the industry.

### Preventive Measures

Preventing unauthorized transactions requires a proactive approach involving clear communication, documentation, and oversight. Key preventive measures include:

- **Maintaining Clear Communication with Clients:**
  - Regular and transparent communication with clients helps ensure that they are informed about account activities and can provide timely consent for transactions.

- **Proper Documentation of Client Instructions and Authorizations:**
  - Maintaining accurate records of client instructions and authorizations is crucial for compliance and can serve as evidence in case of disputes.

- **Regular Oversight and Supervision by Compliance Departments:**
  - Compliance departments should conduct regular audits and reviews of trading activities to detect and prevent unauthorized transactions.

- **Training and Education:**
  - Continuous training and education for registered representatives on regulatory requirements and ethical standards can help prevent unauthorized transactions.

### Glossary

- **Unauthorized Transaction:** A trade executed without the customer's permission.
- **Discretionary Authority:** Permission granted by a client to a representative to make investment decisions on their behalf.
- **Forgery:** Fraudulent alteration or creation of documents.
