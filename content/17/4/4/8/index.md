## 4.4.8 Sharing in Customer Accounts and Guarantees

In the securities industry, maintaining the integrity of customer accounts and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards is paramount. This section delves into the intricacies of sharing in customer accounts and providing guarantees against losses, as governed by FINRA Rule 2150. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam and for professionals in the securities field.

### Sharing in Customer Accounts

#### Regulatory Framework

The practice of sharing in customer accounts involves a registered representative participating in the profits or losses of a client's account. This is a sensitive area governed by strict regulations to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure fair treatment of all clients.

##### FINRA Rule 2150(a)

FINRA Rule 2150(a) explicitly prohibits registered representatives from sharing in the profits or losses of a customer's account unless specific conditions are met:

- **Written Authorization**: The representative must obtain prior written authorization from both the firm and the customer. This ensures that all parties are aware of and agree to the terms of the arrangement.
  
- **Proportionate Sharing**: The sharing must be proportionate to the representative's financial contributions to the account. The only exception to this rule applies to accounts owned by immediate family members, where proportionality is not required.

#### Considerations

When considering sharing in customer accounts, several factors must be taken into account to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements:

- **Firm Policies**: Representatives must comply with their firm's internal policies, which may impose stricter standards than those set by FINRA.
  
- **Full Disclosure**: It is essential to provide full disclosure of all terms and agreements related to the sharing arrangement. Transparency helps prevent misunderstandings and potential disputes.

- **Documentation**: Proper documentation is crucial. All agreements and authorizations should be documented and retained as part of the firm's records.

#### Practical Example

Consider a scenario where a registered representative, Alex, wishes to share in the profits of a client's account. Alex must first contribute capital to the account and then obtain written authorization from both the client and the firm. The sharing must be proportionate to Alex's contribution, ensuring compliance with FINRA Rule 2150(a).

### Guaranteeing Against Loss

#### Prohibition

Guaranteeing customers against losses is strictly prohibited under FINRA Rule 2150(b). This rule is designed to prevent representatives from making promises that could mislead clients about the risks associated with investing.

##### FINRA Rule 2150(b)

The rule states that representatives and firms are prohibited from guaranteeing customers against losses in their accounts. This includes any form of assurance that would imply protection from investment risks.

#### Examples of Prohibited Guarantees

- **Reimbursement Promises**: A representative cannot promise to reimburse a client for any losses incurred in their account.
  
- **Assured Returns**: Assuring a client of a specific return on investment is also prohibited, as it misrepresents the inherent risks of investing.

#### Exceptions

While guarantees against losses are prohibited, there are certain exceptions:

- **Refunding Fees**: Representatives may refund fees or commissions in connection with errors or disputes, provided this is done transparently and documented appropriately.

#### Consequences of Violations

Violations of FINRA Rule 2150 can lead to severe consequences, including:

- **Disciplinary Actions**: FINRA and the SEC may impose disciplinary actions on representatives or firms found in violation of these rules.
  
- **Legal Action**: Clients may pursue legal action if they believe they have been misled or if their accounts have been mishandled.

#### Real-World Case Study

In a notable case, a registered representative was found to have promised clients a guaranteed return on their investments. This led to disciplinary action by FINRA, including fines and suspension. The case underscores the importance of adhering to regulatory guidelines and the potential repercussions of violations.

### Best Practices

To avoid potential pitfalls and ensure compliance, consider the following best practices:

- **Avoid Prohibited Arrangements**: Steer clear of any arrangements that could be construed as sharing in profits or guaranteeing against losses.
  
- **Clear Communication**: Maintain open and transparent communication with clients about the risks and terms of their investments.

- **Consult Compliance Departments**: When in doubt, consult your firm's compliance department to ensure that all actions are in line with regulatory requirements.

### Glossary

- **Sharing in Customer Accounts**: Participating in the profits or losses of a client's account.
  
- **Guarantee Against Loss**: Promising to protect a client from investment losses.
