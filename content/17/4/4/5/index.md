## 4.4.5 Selling Away and Outside Business Activities

In the securities industry, maintaining compliance with regulatory standards is crucial for both individual representatives and their firms. Two significant areas of concern are "Selling Away" and "Outside Business Activities" (OBA). These activities, if not properly managed, can lead to severe regulatory penalties and reputational damage. This section provides a detailed exploration of these concepts, their regulatory frameworks, and the necessary compliance steps to avoid potential pitfalls.

### Selling Away

#### Definition and Context

"**Selling Away**" refers to the practice where a registered representative engages in the sale of securities not offered or approved by their employing firm. This typically involves private securities transactions that are conducted without the knowledge or consent of the firm. Such activities are problematic because they bypass the firm's oversight and compliance mechanisms, increasing the risk of fraud and misconduct.

#### Regulatory Framework

**FINRA Rule 3280** governs private securities transactions, requiring representatives to provide prior written notice to their firm before engaging in such activities. The firm must then evaluate the proposed transaction and either approve or disapprove it. If approved, the firm is responsible for supervising the transaction to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

- **Notification Requirement:** Representatives must disclose all relevant details of the transaction, including the nature of the securities, the role of the representative, and any compensation received.
- **Firm's Role:** The firm must assess the transaction for potential conflicts of interest and ensure that it aligns with regulatory standards. If disapproved, the representative must refrain from participating in the transaction.

#### Risks and Consequences

Engaging in Selling Away without proper authorization can lead to significant risks, including:

- **Fraud and Misconduct:** Lack of firm oversight can result in fraudulent activities that harm investors.
- **Regulatory Sanctions:** Violations of FINRA Rule 3280 can result in disciplinary actions such as fines, suspension, or termination of the representative's registration.
- **Reputational Damage:** Both the representative and the firm can suffer reputational harm, affecting their ability to conduct business in the future.

#### Case Study: The Consequences of Selling Away

Consider a scenario where a registered representative, John, decides to sell shares of a private company to his clients without notifying his firm. The company later turns out to be fraudulent, and investors lose their money. John faces disciplinary action from FINRA, including a hefty fine and suspension. His firm, unaware of the transactions, also faces scrutiny for failing to supervise its representative adequately.

### Outside Business Activities (OBA)

#### Definition and Context

"**Outside Business Activities**" involve any business engagement outside the scope of a representative's duties with their member firm. This can include roles such as serving as an officer or director of another company, or receiving compensation from external entities.

#### Regulatory Framework

**FINRA Rule 3270** requires representatives to provide prior written notice to their firm before engaging in any outside business activities. The rule aims to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure that representatives' outside engagements do not interfere with their responsibilities to their firm and clients.

- **Notification Requirement:** Representatives must disclose the nature of the activity, their role, and any compensation involved.
- **Firm's Role:** The firm must evaluate the activity for potential conflicts and decide whether to allow, restrict, or prohibit the engagement.

#### Examples of OBA

- **Corporate Directorships:** Serving as a board member for another company.
- **External Employment:** Working part-time for another organization.
- **Consulting Services:** Providing advisory services to external entities.

#### Firm's Responsibility

Firms are responsible for evaluating the potential impact of OBAs on their operations and client relationships. This involves:

- **Conflict of Interest Assessment:** Determining whether the activity conflicts with the representative's duties to the firm or its clients.
- **Activity Monitoring:** Ensuring that the representative's outside engagements do not compromise their ability to fulfill their responsibilities to the firm.

#### Compliance Steps

To ensure compliance with FINRA rules regarding Selling Away and OBA, representatives and firms should follow these steps:

1. **Disclosure:** Representatives must disclose all outside activities and private securities transactions in writing to their firm.
2. **Approval Process:** Obtain firm approval for any activities that fall under the scope of FINRA Rules 3270 and 3280.
3. **Supervision:** Ensure that approved activities are subject to appropriate supervision and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Glossary

- **Selling Away:** Engaging in private securities transactions without firm approval.
- **Outside Business Activity (OBA):** Any compensated or uncompensated business activity outside the scope of the representative's relationship with their firm.
- **Private Securities Transaction:** Any securities transaction outside the regular course or scope of a representative's employment.
