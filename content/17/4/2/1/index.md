## 4.2.1 Types of Customer Accounts

Understanding the various types of customer accounts is crucial for anyone preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the different account types, their features, and the regulatory considerations associated with each. By mastering these concepts, you will be better equipped to navigate the complexities of the securities industry and excel in your exam.

### Individual Accounts

**Definition and Characteristics:**

An individual account is owned by a single person who has full control over the account. The account holder is solely responsible for all transactions, decisions, and liabilities associated with the account. Individual accounts are the most straightforward type of account, as they involve only one owner and decision-maker.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a young professional, Alex, who decides to open an individual brokerage account to start investing in stocks. Alex has complete control over the account and is responsible for all investment decisions and transactions.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **KYC (Know Your Customer):** Financial institutions must verify the identity of the account holder and assess their suitability for various investment products.
- **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Institutions must adhere to privacy laws and regulations, such as Regulation S-P, to protect the account holder's information.

### Joint Accounts

Joint accounts involve two or more individuals who share ownership and control over the account. There are two primary types of joint accounts:

#### Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS)

**Characteristics:**

- Equal ownership among account holders.
- Upon the death of one party, the deceased's share automatically passes to the surviving account holder(s).

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a married couple, Jamie and Taylor, who open a JTWROS account to manage their investments. If Jamie were to pass away, Taylor would automatically inherit Jamie's share of the account without the need for probate.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Survivorship Rights:** Ensure that account documentation clearly specifies the survivorship rights to avoid legal disputes.
- **Tax Implications:** Consult with a tax advisor to understand potential tax consequences of inheriting account assets.

#### Tenants in Common (TIC)

**Characteristics:**

- Ownership can be unequal, allowing each party to own a specific percentage of the account.
- Upon death, the deceased's share passes to their estate, not the other account holder(s).

**Example Scenario:**

Siblings, Morgan and Riley, open a TIC account with unequal ownership: Morgan owns 60% and Riley owns 40%. If Riley passes away, their 40% share will be distributed according to their will, rather than transferring to Morgan.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Estate Planning:** Ensure that estate plans reflect the ownership structure of the TIC account.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document each party's ownership percentage to prevent disputes.

### Corporate Accounts

Corporate accounts are opened by corporations to manage their investment activities. These accounts require specific documentation to establish authority and control.

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Corporate Resolution:** A document that authorizes specific individuals to transact business on behalf of the corporation.
- **Corporate Charter or Articles of Incorporation:** May be required to verify the corporation's legal status and structure.

**Example Scenario:**

A tech startup, Innovate Inc., opens a corporate brokerage account to invest excess cash. The board of directors passes a corporate resolution authorizing the CFO to manage the account.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Authorized Signatories:** Ensure that only authorized individuals can access and manage the account.
- **Compliance:** Corporations must comply with relevant securities laws and regulations, such as insider trading rules.

### Partnership Accounts

Partnership accounts are designed for partnerships, requiring a partnership agreement that outlines the rights and responsibilities of each partner.

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Partnership Agreement:** Specifies the partners authorized to manage the account and their respective roles.

**Example Scenario:**

A law firm, Smith & Johnson LLP, opens a partnership account to manage its retirement fund. The partnership agreement designates the managing partner as the account's primary signatory.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Fiduciary Duty:** Partners have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the partnership.
- **Dispute Resolution:** The partnership agreement should include provisions for resolving disputes related to the account.

### Trust Accounts

Trust accounts are established to manage assets on behalf of beneficiaries. There are two main types of trust accounts:

#### Revocable Trusts (Living Trusts)

**Characteristics:**

- The grantor retains the ability to change or revoke the trust.
- Provides flexibility in managing and distributing assets.

**Example Scenario:**

An elderly individual, Pat, creates a revocable trust to manage their assets during their lifetime. Pat can modify the trust terms as their financial situation changes.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Trustee Responsibilities:** Trustees must act in the best interest of the beneficiaries.
- **Tax Implications:** Consult with a tax advisor to understand the tax treatment of trust income and distributions.

#### Irrevocable Trusts

**Characteristics:**

- Once established, the trust cannot be modified without the consent of the beneficiaries.
- Offers potential tax benefits and asset protection.

**Example Scenario:**

A wealthy individual, Jordan, establishes an irrevocable trust to provide for their grandchildren's education. The trust terms cannot be changed, ensuring that the assets are used as intended.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Asset Protection:** Irrevocable trusts can protect assets from creditors.
- **Tax Planning:** Irrevocable trusts may offer estate and gift tax benefits.

### Custodial Accounts

Custodial accounts are managed by a custodian for the benefit of a minor. There are two primary types of custodial accounts:

#### Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)

**Characteristics:**

- Allows financial assets to be transferred to a minor.
- The minor gains control of the assets at the age of majority.

**Example Scenario:**

A parent, Casey, opens a UGMA account for their child, Alex, to save for college. When Alex turns 18, they gain full control of the account.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Custodian Responsibilities:** The custodian must manage the account in the best interest of the minor.
- **Age of Majority:** The age at which the minor gains control varies by state.

#### Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)

**Characteristics:**

- Similar to UGMA, but allows a broader range of assets, including real estate and patents.
- The custodian can extend the age of transfer beyond the age of majority.

**Example Scenario:**

A grandparent, Taylor, opens a UTMA account for their grandchild, Jordan, including both stocks and a piece of real estate. Taylor decides to extend the transfer age to 21.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Asset Management:** The custodian must manage a potentially diverse range of assets.
- **Transfer Age:** The custodian can choose to extend the transfer age, providing flexibility in asset management.

### Estate Accounts

Estate accounts are established to manage and distribute a deceased person's assets according to their will or intestacy laws. These accounts are managed by an executor or administrator.

**Example Scenario:**

After the passing of a family member, the executor of the estate, Sam, opens an estate account to pay debts and distribute assets to the heirs.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Fiduciary Duty:** The executor has a fiduciary duty to manage the estate's assets responsibly.
- **Probate Process:** Estate accounts are subject to probate, which can vary by jurisdiction.

### Discretionary Accounts

In discretionary accounts, the client grants authority to a registered representative to make investment decisions on their behalf without prior approval for each transaction.

**Requirements:**

- **Written Authorization:** The client must provide written consent for discretionary trading.
- **Principal Approval:** A principal must approve and oversee the account's activities.

**Example Scenario:**

A busy executive, Jordan, opens a discretionary account with a financial advisor, allowing the advisor to make investment decisions based on Jordan's risk tolerance and financial goals.

**Regulatory Considerations:**

- **Suitability:** The registered representative must ensure that investment decisions align with the client's financial situation and objectives.
- **Oversight:** Regular reviews by a principal are required to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

### Glossary

- **Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS):** A joint account where ownership passes to surviving owners upon death.
- **Tenants in Common (TIC):** A joint account where ownership passes to the decedent's estate upon death.
- **Custodial Account:** An account managed by a custodian for the benefit of a minor.
