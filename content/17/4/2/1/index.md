## 4.2.1 Types of Customer Accounts

Understanding the various types of customer accounts is crucial for anyone preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the different account types, their characteristics, and the regulatory considerations associated with each. By mastering this material, you will be better equipped to advise clients and manage accounts within the securities industry.

### Individual Accounts

Individual accounts are the most straightforward type of account, owned and controlled by a single person. The account holder is solely responsible for all transactions, decisions, and liabilities associated with the account. Individual accounts are often used for personal investments and savings.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Control:** The account holder has full control over the account and is the only person authorized to make decisions and transactions.
  - **Responsibility:** The individual is responsible for all gains, losses, and tax liabilities.
  - **Privacy:** Offers a higher level of privacy as only one person is involved.

- **Example Scenario:** Jane Doe opens an individual brokerage account to manage her stock portfolio. She alone makes all investment decisions and is responsible for any tax implications.

### Joint Accounts

Joint accounts are held by two or more individuals and can be structured in different ways, depending on the ownership rights and responsibilities.

#### Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS)

In a JTWROS account, all parties have equal ownership. Upon the death of one account holder, the ownership automatically passes to the surviving account holder(s).

- **Key Features:**
  - **Equal Ownership:** Each account holder owns an equal share of the account.
  - **Survivorship Rights:** Upon the death of one owner, the account assets pass directly to the surviving owner(s), bypassing probate.

- **Example Scenario:** John and Mary Smith hold a JTWROS account. When John passes away, Mary automatically becomes the sole owner of the account assets.

#### Tenants in Common (TIC)

In a TIC account, ownership can be unequal, and each owner's share is part of their estate upon death.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Unequal Ownership:** Owners can hold unequal shares of the account.
  - **Estate Transfer:** Upon death, an owner's share is transferred according to their will or estate plan, not to the surviving account holder(s).

- **Example Scenario:** Alex and Sam have a TIC account where Alex owns 60% and Sam owns 40%. If Alex dies, his 60% share is distributed according to his will.

### Corporate Accounts

Corporate accounts are opened by businesses and require specific documentation to authorize individuals to act on behalf of the corporation.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Corporate Resolution:** A document that specifies which individuals are authorized to make transactions on behalf of the corporation.
  - **Documentation Requirements:** May include articles of incorporation, corporate charter, and other legal documents.

- **Example Scenario:** XYZ Corporation opens a brokerage account to manage its investment portfolio. The corporate resolution authorizes the CFO to execute trades.

### Partnership Accounts

Partnership accounts are established by partnerships and require a partnership agreement that outlines authorized individuals.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Partnership Agreement:** Details the individuals authorized to act on behalf of the partnership.
  - **Shared Responsibility:** All partners share responsibility for the account.

- **Example Scenario:** A law firm structured as a partnership opens an account to manage firm investments. The partnership agreement specifies which partners can make investment decisions.

### Trust Accounts

Trust accounts are established to manage assets on behalf of beneficiaries and can be either revocable or irrevocable.

#### Revocable Trusts (Living Trusts)

Revocable trusts allow the grantor to modify or revoke the trust during their lifetime.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Flexibility:** The grantor can change or terminate the trust.
  - **Control:** The grantor retains control over the assets during their lifetime.

- **Example Scenario:** A revocable trust is set up by a parent to manage assets for their children, with the parent retaining control over the trust.

#### Irrevocable Trusts

Irrevocable trusts cannot be altered once established without the consent of the beneficiaries.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Permanent:** Once established, the trust cannot be changed.
  - **Tax Benefits:** Often used for estate planning to reduce tax liabilities.

- **Example Scenario:** An irrevocable trust is created to provide for a child's education, with specific terms that cannot be altered.

### Custodial Accounts

Custodial accounts are managed by a custodian for the benefit of a minor, typically under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA).

#### Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)

UGMA accounts allow minors to own securities, with the custodian managing the assets until the minor reaches the age of majority.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Financial Assets:** Limited to financial assets like stocks and bonds.
  - **Transfer at Majority:** Assets are transferred to the minor at the age of majority.

- **Example Scenario:** A grandparent opens a UGMA account for their grandchild, investing in stocks until the child turns 18.

#### Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)

UTMA accounts are similar to UGMA but allow a broader range of assets and may extend the age of transfer.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Broader Asset Range:** Includes real estate and other tangible assets.
  - **Extended Age:** The custodian can extend the transfer age beyond the age of majority, depending on state law.

- **Example Scenario:** A parent opens a UTMA account for their child, including both stocks and real estate, with transfer at age 21.

### Estate Accounts

Estate accounts are used to manage and distribute a deceased person's assets according to their will or intestacy laws.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Executor/Administrator:** Managed by an appointed executor or administrator.
  - **Asset Distribution:** Used to settle debts and distribute assets to beneficiaries.

- **Example Scenario:** An estate account is opened to manage the assets of a deceased individual, ensuring debts are paid and remaining assets are distributed to heirs.

### Discretionary Accounts

Discretionary accounts grant authority to a registered representative to make investment decisions without prior client approval for each transaction.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Written Authorization:** Requires written consent from the client.
  - **Principal Oversight:** Must be approved and monitored by a principal.

- **Example Scenario:** A client grants discretionary authority to their financial advisor, allowing the advisor to make trades based on market conditions.
