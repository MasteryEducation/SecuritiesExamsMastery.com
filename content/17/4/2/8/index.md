## 4.2.8 Discretionary and Fiduciary Accounts

In the realm of securities and investment management, discretionary and fiduciary accounts play critical roles. Understanding these account types is essential for anyone preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam. This section will provide a comprehensive overview of discretionary and fiduciary accounts, their regulatory requirements, potential risks, and relevant legal frameworks.

### Discretionary Accounts

#### Definition and Overview

A discretionary account is an investment account where the customer grants a registered representative (RR) or investment adviser representative (IAR) the authority to make investment decisions on their behalf without obtaining prior consent for each transaction. This arrangement is particularly useful for clients who prefer to delegate investment decisions to professionals due to time constraints or lack of expertise.

#### Requirements for Discretionary Accounts

1. **Written Authorization:**
   - Customers must provide a signed discretionary authorization or trading authorization. This document grants the RR or IAR the legal right to make investment decisions on behalf of the client.

2. **Principal Approval:**
   - The broker-dealer must approve the discretionary authority and continuously monitor account activity to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and the client’s investment objectives.

3. **Types of Discretion:**
   - **Limited Discretion:** The RR or IAR has the authority to make trading decisions but cannot withdraw funds from the account.
   - **Full Discretion:** The RR or IAR can make trading decisions and withdraw funds, though this level of discretion is rare and requires additional authorization and oversight.

#### Regulatory Considerations

1. **FINRA Rule 3260:**
   - This rule governs discretionary accounts, requiring proper written authorization and supervision. It mandates that all discretionary accounts be approved by a principal and that each transaction be reviewed for suitability.

2. **Suitability and Best Execution:**
   - RRs must ensure that trades are suitable for the client’s financial situation and investment objectives. They are also required to execute trades in the client’s best interest, ensuring the best possible execution of orders.

#### Risks and Potential for Abuse

1. **Churning:**
   - This involves excessive trading in a discretionary account to generate commissions for the RR, which is unethical and illegal.

2. **Unauthorized Transactions:**
   - Making trades beyond the scope of the granted authority can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions for both the RR and the firm.

#### Practical Example

Consider a scenario where a client, Jane, is too busy to manage her investments actively. She grants discretionary authority to her RR, John, who then makes investment decisions on her behalf. John must ensure that each trade aligns with Jane’s investment goals and risk tolerance. If John begins to trade excessively to increase his commissions, he would be engaging in churning, a prohibited activity under FINRA regulations.

### Fiduciary Accounts

#### Definition and Overview

Fiduciary accounts are managed by fiduciaries, individuals or entities with a legal duty to act in the best interest of another person or entity (the beneficiary). Fiduciaries are obligated to manage the assets with the highest level of care and loyalty.

#### Types of Fiduciaries

1. **Trustees:**
   - Manage assets held in a trust for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries.

2. **Executors/Administrators:**
   - Handle the estates of deceased individuals, ensuring that the decedent’s assets are distributed according to their will or state law.

3. **Guardians:**
   - Manage assets for minors or incapacitated individuals, ensuring their financial well-being.

4. **Receivers in Bankruptcy:**
   - Administrators appointed to manage the assets of a bankrupt entity, ensuring fair distribution among creditors.

#### Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

1. **Prudent Investor Rule:**
   - Fiduciaries must manage assets with care, skill, and caution, considering the needs of the beneficiaries and the purpose of the trust or estate.

2. **No Commingling:**
   - Fiduciaries must keep fiduciary assets separate from their personal assets to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure transparency.

3. **Legal Documentation:**
   - Fiduciaries must provide appropriate legal documents, such as a trust agreement or court appointment, to open and manage accounts.

#### Regulatory Considerations

1. **Suitability and Fiduciary Duty:**
   - Investment decisions must align with the beneficiary’s best interests and objectives. Fiduciaries must avoid conflicts of interest and act with loyalty and care.

2. **Restrictions:**
   - Fiduciaries may face limitations on the types of investments or strategies they can employ, as dictated by governing documents or applicable laws.

#### Practical Example

Imagine a trust established for a minor, Alex, with his aunt, Sarah, as the trustee. Sarah is responsible for managing the trust assets until Alex reaches adulthood. She must invest the assets prudently, ensuring they grow over time while considering Alex’s future needs. Sarah cannot use the trust assets for personal gain or commingle them with her own funds.
