## 4.2.2 New Account Documentation

In the securities industry, the process of opening a new account is foundational to the relationship between a broker-dealer and their clients. Understanding the requirements and regulations surrounding new account documentation is crucial for aspiring securities professionals, not only for passing the SIE Exam but also for ensuring compliance with industry standards. This section delves into the essential components of new account documentation, outlining the necessary customer information, legal and regulatory requirements, and best practices for maintaining compliance.

### Customer Information Required

#### Personal Information

When opening a new account, broker-dealers must collect comprehensive personal information from their clients. This includes:

- **Full Legal Name:** Ensures the customer's identity is accurately recorded and verified.
- **Date of Birth:** Confirms the customer is of legal age to engage in securities transactions.
- **Social Security Number (SSN) or Tax Identification Number (TIN):** Used for tax reporting and identity verification.
- **Contact Information:** Includes the customer's current residential address, phone number, and email address for communication and account management purposes.

#### Identification Verification

To comply with the Customer Identification Program (CIP) requirements, firms must verify the identity of their clients using government-issued photo identification. Acceptable forms of ID include:

- **Driver's License**
- **Passport**
- **State-Issued ID Card**

This verification process helps prevent identity theft and fraudulent activities, aligning with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts.

#### Employment Information

Understanding a client's employment status and history is vital for assessing their financial stability and investment capacity. Required details include:

- **Occupation:** Provides insight into the client's professional background.
- **Employer Name and Address:** Helps verify employment status and assess potential conflicts of interest.

#### Financial Information

Gathering detailed financial information allows broker-dealers to tailor investment recommendations to the client's financial situation. Key components include:

- **Annual Income:** Indicates the client's earning capacity and potential investment budget.
- **Net Worth:** Reflects the client's total assets minus liabilities, providing a snapshot of their financial health.
- **Liquid Net Worth:** Represents the portion of net worth that can be quickly converted to cash, crucial for understanding liquidity needs.

#### Investment Objectives and Risk Tolerance

Understanding a client's investment goals and risk appetite is essential for making suitable recommendations. This involves:

- **Goals for the Account:** Whether the client seeks growth, income, or capital preservation.
- **Time Horizon:** The expected duration for holding investments, influencing risk tolerance.
- **Risk Appetite:** The level of risk the client is willing to accept in pursuit of their investment goals.

#### Regulatory Disclosure Information

Broker-dealers must ascertain whether a client is an insider or affiliated with another broker-dealer. This information is crucial for regulatory compliance and preventing conflicts of interest.

### Legal and Regulatory Requirements

#### Know Your Customer (KYC)

The KYC obligation requires broker-dealers to use reasonable diligence to understand the essential facts about each customer. This ensures that the firm can effectively service the account, make suitable recommendations, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

#### Account Agreements

Several key documents are involved in the account opening process:

- **New Account Form:** Captures all required customer information, serving as the primary record for the account.
- **Margin Agreement (if applicable):** Authorizes margin trading and includes a credit agreement, hypothecation agreement, and loan consent form. Margin accounts allow clients to borrow funds to purchase securities, increasing both potential returns and risks.
- **Options Account Agreement (if applicable):** Required for options trading, this document outlines the customer's understanding of the risks involved and their financial capability to engage in such transactions.

#### Privacy Notice (Regulation S-P)

At the time of account opening, firms must provide a privacy notice explaining how customer information is used and shared. This notice is part of Regulation S-P, which governs the privacy of consumer financial information.

#### Suitability Obligations

Broker-dealers are obligated to ensure that any recommendations made are suitable for the customer based on their profile. This involves considering the client's financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.

### Customer Signature Requirements

While a customer signature is not always required for cash accounts, it is mandatory for:

- **Margin Agreements:** To confirm the client's understanding and acceptance of margin trading risks.
- **Options Agreements:** To acknowledge the risks associated with options trading.
- **Discretionary Account Authorizations:** To grant the broker-dealer authority to make investment decisions on behalf of the client.

### Recordkeeping Requirements

Firms must retain account records for at least six years after the account is closed. This requirement ensures that all relevant information is available for regulatory review and compliance purposes.

### Glossary

- **Customer Identification Program (CIP):** Regulations requiring verification of customers' identities to prevent money laundering.
- **Know Your Customer (KYC):** Obligation to understand essential facts about each customer.
- **Margin Agreement:** Contract allowing customers to borrow funds for investment purposes.
