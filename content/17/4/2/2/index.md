This section will guide you through the essential components of new account documentation, ensuring you are well-prepared for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam and your future career in the securities industry.

### Customer Information Required

When opening a new account, broker-dealers must gather comprehensive information about the customer to comply with regulatory standards and ensure the suitability of investments. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the required information:

#### Personal Information

- **Full Legal Name**: The customer's full name as it appears on legal documents.

- **Social Security Number (SSN) or Tax Identification Number (TIN)**: Essential for tax reporting and identity verification.
- **Contact Information**: Includes address, phone number, and email address for communication and recordkeeping.

#### Identification Verification

Under the Customer Identification Program (CIP), broker-dealers must verify the identity of their customers. This involves:

- **Government-Issued Photo ID**: Such as a driver's license or passport. The ID must be current and valid.
- **Compliance with CIP Requirements**: Ensures that the customer is who they claim to be, helping to prevent fraud and money laundering.

#### Employment Information

- **Occupation**: Understanding the customer's job can provide insight into their financial stability and investment knowledge.
- **Employer Name and Address**: Helps verify employment status and assess potential conflicts of interest or insider trading risks.

#### Financial Information

- **Annual Income**: Provides an overview of the customer's earning capacity.
- **Net Worth**: Total assets minus liabilities, indicating the customer's overall financial health.
- **Liquid Net Worth**: The portion of net worth that can be quickly converted to cash, crucial for assessing investment risk tolerance.

#### Investment Objectives and Risk Tolerance

- **Goals for the Account**: Whether the customer seeks growth, income, or preservation of capital.
- **Time Horizon**: The expected duration for holding investments, which influences risk tolerance.

#### Regulatory Disclosure Information

- **Insider Status**: Whether the customer holds a position that might influence securities trading, such as being a director or officer of a publicly traded company.
- **Affiliation with Another Broker-Dealer**: Disclosures help prevent conflicts of interest and ensure compliance with industry regulations.

### Legal and Regulatory Requirements

The legal framework governing new account documentation is designed to protect both the customer and the broker-dealer. Key aspects include:

#### Know Your Customer (KYC)

KYC is a fundamental principle requiring broker-dealers to use reasonable diligence to know the essential facts about each customer. This includes:

- **Customer's Financial Situation**: Understanding their ability to bear investment risks.
- **Investment Experience**: Gauging their familiarity with different types of securities.
- **Investment Objectives**: Aligning recommendations with the customer's goals.

#### Account Agreements

Several documents are required to formalize the customer-broker relationship:

- **New Account Form**: Captures all necessary customer information and serves as the foundation for the account.
- **Margin Agreement (if applicable)**: Required for customers who wish to engage in margin trading. It includes:
  - **Credit Agreement**: Outlines the terms under which the broker-dealer extends credit.
  - **Hypothecation Agreement**: Allows the broker to use the customer's securities as collateral.
  - **Loan Consent Form**: Permits the broker to lend the customer's securities to others.
- **Options Account Agreement (if applicable)**: Necessary for options trading, ensuring the customer understands the risks involved.

#### Privacy Notice (Regulation S-P)

Broker-dealers must provide a privacy notice at the account opening, detailing how customer information is collected, used, and shared. This notice must comply with Regulation S-P, ensuring transparency and customer privacy protection.

#### Suitability Obligations

Firms are obligated to ensure that any investment recommendations are suitable for the customer based on their profile. This involves:

- **Assessing Customer Information**: Using the data collected to make informed recommendations.
- **Documenting the Rationale**: Keeping records of why a particular investment is deemed suitable.

### Customer Signature Requirements

While not always required for cash accounts, customer signatures are essential for:

- **Margin Agreements**: To authorize borrowing against securities.
- **Options Agreements**: To confirm understanding of options trading risks.
- **Discretionary Account Authorizations**: To permit the broker to make decisions on behalf of the customer.

### Recordkeeping Requirements

Broker-dealers must maintain accurate records of all customer accounts. Key requirements include:

- **Retention Period**: Account records must be kept for at least six years after the account is closed.
- **Accessibility**: Records should be readily accessible for regulatory review and audits.
