## 4.3.2 Advertising and Sales Literature

In the fast-paced world of securities, effective communication is crucial. Advertising and sales literature play a pivotal role in how securities firms convey information to the public and potential investors. Understanding the regulatory landscape governing these communications is essential for compliance and success on the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam.

### Definitions and Distinctions

#### Advertising

Advertising refers to communications intended for broad distribution through mass media channels. This includes newspapers, magazines, radio, television, billboards, and internet banners. The goal is to reach a wide audience with consistent messaging about a firm's products or services.

#### Sales Literature

Sales literature, on the other hand, is more targeted. It includes written or electronic communications directed at a specific audience, such as brochures, research reports, form letters, market letters, and seminar materials. These are typically distributed to more than 25 retail investors and are designed to provide detailed information on specific investment opportunities.

### Content Standards

The content of advertising and sales literature must adhere to strict standards to ensure accuracy, fairness, and transparency.

#### Accuracy and Truthfulness

- **Fair Presentation:** Information must be presented fairly and accurately, avoiding false, exaggerated, or misleading statements. This ensures that investors can make informed decisions based on reliable data.
- **Balanced Discussions:** Communications must provide a balanced view of the risks and benefits associated with an investment or strategy. Highlighting potential benefits without equally emphasizing risks is prohibited.

#### Performance Information

- **Use of Performance Data:** When including past performance data, it must not imply future results. Performance data should be contextualized with relevant details such as time periods, applicable fees, and conditions that affected performance.
- **Required Disclosures:** All performance information must include disclosures that clarify the context and limitations of the data presented.

#### Testimonials

Testimonials can be a powerful tool but must be used with caution. They are allowed under certain conditions, including:

- **Disclosure of Compensation:** If the testimonial giver is compensated, this must be disclosed to avoid conflicts of interest.
- **Accuracy:** Testimonials should accurately reflect the experience of the individual and not mislead potential investors.

#### Use of "Free"

The term "free" can only be used if there are no conditions or obligations attached. Misleading use of "free" to entice potential investors is strictly prohibited.

### Prohibited Practices

Certain practices are explicitly prohibited to protect investors and maintain market integrity.

#### Predictions and Projections

- **No Guarantees:** Advertisements and sales literature cannot predict or project investment performance or imply guaranteed results. Any hypothetical illustrations must be reasonable and accompanied by clear explanations.

#### Use of Professional Designations

- **Accurate Representation:** Professional designations must accurately represent qualifications and expertise. Misleading representations about one's qualifications are not allowed.

### Approval and Filing Requirements

Compliance with approval and filing requirements is crucial for all advertising and sales literature.

#### Prior Principal Approval

- **Retail Communication:** Any advertising and sales literature classified as retail communication requires prior approval by a principal before first use. This ensures that all communications meet regulatory standards.

#### Filing with FINRA

- **Pre-Use Filing:** New member firms or communications involving specific investment products, such as mutual funds with performance rankings, require pre-use filing with FINRA.
- **Post-Use Filing:** Generally, communications must be filed within 10 business days of first use.

#### Recordkeeping

Firms must maintain copies of all advertisements and sales literature, along with approval records, for at least three years. This is essential for compliance audits and regulatory reviews.

### Third-Party Materials

Firms are responsible for the content of materials produced by third parties if distributed by the firm. This includes ensuring that third-party content meets all regulatory requirements.

### Advertising and Sales Literature and the SIE Exam

For the SIE Exam, it's important to understand:

- **Definitions and Differences:** Recognize the distinctions between advertising and sales literature.
- **Content Standards and Prohibitions:** Be familiar with the content standards, prohibitions, and required disclosures.
- **Approval and Filing Requirements:** Understand the processes for approval, filing, and recordkeeping.

### Regulatory Framework

#### FINRA Rule 2210: Communications with the Public

FINRA Rule 2210 outlines the requirements for communications with the public, including advertising and sales literature. It emphasizes the need for accuracy, balance, and transparency in all communications.

#### SEC Guidance on Advertising

The SEC provides guidance on advertising by investment advisers, focusing on ensuring that all communications are fair and not misleading.

#### FINRA Regulatory Notices

FINRA regularly issues regulatory notices, such as those on the use of rankings in communications, to provide additional guidance and clarification on compliance requirements.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

To illustrate these concepts, consider the following scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Misleading Performance Data**
   - A firm advertises a mutual fund with exceptional past performance. However, the advertisement fails to disclose that the performance was achieved during an unusually favorable market period. This omission could mislead investors about the fund's potential future performance.

2. **Scenario 2: Use of Testimonials**
   - An investment adviser uses a testimonial from a satisfied client in their sales literature. The adviser compensates the client for their testimonial but fails to disclose this in the literature. This lack of disclosure could lead to regulatory action for misleading advertising.

3. **Scenario 3: Improper Use of "Free"**
   - A brokerage firm advertises "free" financial planning services, but clients must purchase a specific product to qualify. This misleading use of "free" could result in penalties for deceptive advertising practices.

### Best Practices for Compliance

1. **Regular Training:** Ensure all staff involved in creating advertising and sales literature are regularly trained on regulatory requirements and best practices.
2. **Review Processes:** Implement thorough review processes to ensure all communications meet content standards before dissemination.
3. **Clear Disclosures:** Make sure all required disclosures are clear, complete, and prominently displayed in all communications.
4. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of all communications, approvals, and filings to facilitate compliance audits.

### Conclusion

Mastering the intricacies of advertising and sales literature is essential for compliance and success in the securities industry. By understanding the regulatory framework and adhering to content standards, you can ensure that your communications are both effective and compliant. As you prepare for the SIE Exam, focus on these key concepts and best practices to enhance your understanding and confidence.
