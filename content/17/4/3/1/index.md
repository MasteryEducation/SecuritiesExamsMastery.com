## 4.3.1 Communications with the Public

Effective communication is a cornerstone of the securities industry, ensuring transparency and trust between firms and investors. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has established Rule 2210 to govern how firms communicate with the public. Understanding this rule is crucial for anyone preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam, as it covers the standards and procedures for creating and distributing communications.

### Regulatory Framework

FINRA Rule 2210 is the primary regulation that governs communications with the public. This rule sets the standards for the content, approval, recordkeeping, and filing of communications. It ensures that all communications are fair, balanced, and not misleading, protecting investors from false or exaggerated claims.

#### Key Components of FINRA Rule 2210

- **Content Standards:** Ensures communications are fair, balanced, and not misleading.
- **Approval and Recordkeeping:** Requires principal approval and proper recordkeeping.
- **Filing Requirements:** Specifies when communications must be filed with FINRA.
- **Social Media and Electronic Communications:** Addresses the use of social media and electronic platforms.

### Categories of Communication

Communications with the public are divided into three categories: Retail Communication, Correspondence, and Institutional Communication. Each category has specific requirements and standards.

#### Retail Communication

Retail communication refers to any written or electronic communication distributed to more than 25 retail investors within any 30-day period. Retail investors are individuals who are not classified as institutional investors, regardless of whether they have an account with the firm.

- **Examples:** Advertisements, sales literature, and certain social media posts.
- **Requirements:** Must be approved by a registered principal before use and may need to be filed with FINRA.

#### Correspondence

Correspondence includes written or electronic communication distributed to 25 or fewer retail investors within any 30-day period. This category includes emails, letters, and text messages.

- **Examples:** Personalized emails, letters to clients, and text messages.
- **Requirements:** Subject to supervision and spot-checking, but prior approval is not always required unless it contains investment recommendations.

#### Institutional Communication

Institutional communication is distributed exclusively to institutional investors, such as banks, insurance companies, and registered investment companies. Institutional investors also include entities with assets of $50 million or more.

- **Examples:** Reports sent to institutional clients, presentations for institutional investors.
- **Requirements:** Generally does not require prior approval but must be supervised and may be subject to spot-checking.

### Content Standards

FINRA Rule 2210 mandates that all communications must adhere to strict content standards to protect investors and maintain market integrity.

#### Fair and Balanced

Communications must present information in a fair and balanced manner. They should not be misleading and must include the risks associated with investments.

- **Example:** If promoting a mutual fund, the communication must include both potential benefits and risks, such as market volatility.

#### Prohibitions

- **False or Exaggerated Claims:** Communications must not contain false, exaggerated, or misleading statements.
- **Promises of Future Performance:** Firms cannot guarantee or imply that past performance will recur.
- **Omission of Material Facts:** Important information must not be omitted if it would render the communication misleading.

#### Clear and Understandable Language

Communications should use plain language suitable for the audience's level of sophistication. This ensures that investors can make informed decisions based on the information provided.

### Approval and Recordkeeping

Proper approval and recordkeeping are essential components of FINRA Rule 2210, ensuring accountability and compliance.

#### Principal Approval

- **Retail Communication:** Requires prior approval by a registered principal (Series 24) before use or filing with FINRA.
- **Correspondence and Institutional Communication:** Subject to supervision and spot-checking but may not require prior approval unless it contains investment recommendations.

#### Filing Requirements

Certain retail communications must be filed with FINRA, either 10 business days prior to first use (for new firms or specific content) or within 10 business days after first use.

#### Record Retention

Firms must retain copies of all communications for at least three years from the date of last use. This ensures that there is a record of all communications for regulatory review if necessary.

### Social Media and Electronic Communications

The rise of social media and electronic communications has introduced new challenges and opportunities for the securities industry. FINRA Rule 2210 addresses these modern communication channels.

#### Interactive Content

Interactive content, such as real-time social media interactions, is treated as correspondence. This includes tweets, Facebook comments, and LinkedIn interactions.

- **Requirements:** Subject to supervision but does not require prior approval unless it contains investment recommendations.

#### Static Content

Static content, such as a firm's profile page or a blog post, is treated as retail communication and may require prior approval.

- **Requirements:** Must comply with content standards and may need to be filed with FINRA.

#### Supervision

Firms must have policies and procedures in place to supervise electronic communications, ensuring compliance with FINRA rules.

### Customer Communications and the SIE Exam

Understanding the categories of communications and their associated requirements is crucial for the SIE Exam. Candidates must recognize the content standards and prohibitions to ensure compliance and be familiar with approval, filing, and recordkeeping obligations.
