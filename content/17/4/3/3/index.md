## 4.3.3 Electronic Communications and Social Media

In today's digital age, electronic communications and social media have become integral to how businesses operate, including those in the securities industry. Understanding the regulatory framework governing these communications is crucial for compliance and effective business practices. This section will delve into the guidelines and requirements set forth by regulatory bodies like FINRA, focusing on the use of electronic communications and social media in the securities industry.

### Regulatory Framework

#### FINRA Regulatory Notices

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has issued several notices to guide firms on the appropriate use of electronic communications, including social media, blogs, and messaging apps. These notices emphasize the need for firms to supervise and archive all business-related electronic communications to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

- **FINRA Regulatory Notice 11-39**: This notice provides specific guidance on the use of social media websites and personal devices for business communications. It highlights the importance of maintaining records and ensuring that all communications adhere to the same standards as traditional forms of communication.

- **Key Takeaway**: Firms must treat electronic communications with the same level of scrutiny as other forms of communication, ensuring they are fair, balanced, and not misleading.

### Types of Electronic Communications

Understanding the different types of electronic communications is essential for compliance and effective supervision.

#### Static Content

Static content refers to electronic communications that do not change frequently, such as firm websites and profile pages on social media platforms. This type of content is treated as retail communication and requires prior principal approval before being published.

- **Example**: A brokerage firm's official Facebook page, which includes information about the firm's services and contact details, is considered static content.

- **Regulatory Requirement**: Static content must be approved by a principal before it is made public. It should be regularly reviewed to ensure continued compliance with regulatory standards.

#### Interactive Content

Interactive content includes real-time communications such as social media posts, tweets, and comments. This type of content is treated as correspondence and is subject to supervision and spot-checking but may not require prior approval.

- **Example**: A financial advisor responding to a client's question on Twitter in real-time is engaging in interactive content.

- **Regulatory Requirement**: While prior approval may not be necessary, firms must have systems in place to supervise and archive interactive communications to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

### Supervision and Compliance

Effective supervision and compliance are critical components of managing electronic communications within the securities industry.

#### Policies and Procedures

Firms are required to have written supervisory procedures that address the use of electronic communications. These procedures should include guidelines on permissible content, approval processes, and training for employees.

- **Best Practice**: Regularly update supervisory procedures to reflect changes in technology and regulatory requirements. Conduct training sessions to ensure all employees understand and adhere to these procedures.

#### Recordkeeping

All business-related electronic communications must be retained for at least three years, regardless of whether they are conducted on personal or firm-issued devices.

- **Example**: A financial advisor using a personal smartphone to communicate with clients must ensure that all business-related messages are archived and retrievable for compliance purposes.

- **Regulatory Requirement**: Firms must implement systems to capture and store all relevant communications, ensuring they can be accessed and reviewed as needed.

#### Third-Party Posts

Firms are responsible for any third-party content they have adopted or endorsed. This includes comments and testimonials on social media platforms.

- **Example**: If a firm retweets a client's positive comment about their services, they are considered to have adopted that content and must ensure it complies with regulatory standards.

- **Regulatory Requirement**: Establish policies for handling third-party content, ensuring that any adopted or endorsed content meets regulatory standards for accuracy and fairness.

#### Use of Personal Devices

The use of personal devices for business communications is a common practice, but it requires careful supervision to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

- **Best Practice**: Require employees to use approved applications or platforms for business communications on personal devices. Implement monitoring systems to ensure compliance.

### Content Standards

The content of electronic communications must adhere to the same standards as other forms of communication within the securities industry.

#### Fair, Balanced, and Not Misleading

All communications must be fair, balanced, and not misleading. This includes avoiding exaggerated claims, omissions, and guarantees.

- **Example**: A social media post promoting a new investment product must provide a balanced view of the potential risks and rewards, avoiding any misleading statements.

- **Regulatory Requirement**: Implement review processes to ensure all communications meet these standards before they are published.

#### Privacy and Confidentiality

Protecting customer information and complying with privacy regulations is paramount in all electronic communications.

- **Example**: A financial advisor must ensure that no confidential client information is disclosed in any public forum or social media platform.

- **Regulatory Requirement**: Develop and enforce policies to protect customer information, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as Regulation S-P.
