SROs develop and enforce rules that govern the conduct of their members and the operation of the markets they oversee. These rules are designed to promote transparency, fairness, and investor protection.

SROs conduct continuous monitoring of trading activities to detect and prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices. This includes analyzing trading patterns, investigating suspicious activities, and taking corrective actions as needed.

When violations occur, SROs have the authority to investigate and impose sanctions on members. These sanctions can range from fines and suspensions to expulsion from the organization.

SROs implement measures to safeguard market integrity and protect investor interests. This includes ensuring that member firms adhere to ethical standards and providing educational resources to help investors make informed decisions.
