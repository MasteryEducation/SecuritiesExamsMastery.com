## 5.2.2 MSRB Rules for Municipal Securities

The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the municipal securities market in the United States. This section will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the MSRB's rules, their significance, and how they impact the securities industry. This knowledge is essential for anyone preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam.

### Overview of the MSRB

The MSRB is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) established by Congress in 1975 under the Securities Acts Amendments. Its primary objective is to protect investors, municipal entities, and the public interest by promoting a fair and efficient municipal securities market. The MSRB achieves this by creating rules for broker-dealers and banks that engage in municipal securities transactions.

### MSRB’s Structure and Authority

#### Rulemaking

The MSRB is responsible for developing rules that regulate the activities of municipal securities dealers and municipal advisors. These rules are designed to ensure ethical conduct, transparency, and fairness in the municipal securities market. However, it is important to note that the MSRB does not have enforcement power. Instead, its rules are enforced by other regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for broker-dealers, and by bank regulators for dealer banks.

#### No Enforcement Power

While the MSRB sets the rules, it relies on other regulatory agencies to enforce them. The SEC and FINRA are primarily responsible for enforcing MSRB rules for broker-dealers, while bank regulators enforce rules for banks that deal in municipal securities.

#### EMMA System

The MSRB operates the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system, which provides free public access to municipal securities disclosures, trade data, and other market information. EMMA is a vital tool for investors, allowing them to make informed decisions by accessing comprehensive information about municipal securities.

### Key MSRB Rules

The MSRB's rules are organized into a series known as the "G-Rules." These rules cover various aspects of municipal securities transactions, from ethical conduct to professional qualifications.

#### Rule G-17 (Conduct of Municipal Securities Activities)

Rule G-17 requires dealers to deal fairly with all persons and prohibits deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practices. This rule is fundamental in maintaining integrity and trust in the municipal securities market.

#### Rule G-19 (Suitability of Recommendations)

Under Rule G-19, dealers must ensure that any recommendations made to customers are suitable based on the customer's financial situation, needs, and objectives. This rule emphasizes the importance of understanding the customer's profile before making investment recommendations.

#### Rule G-37 (Political Contributions and Prohibitions on Municipal Securities Business)

Rule G-37 addresses the issue of "pay-to-play" practices by limiting political contributions by dealers. It prohibits dealers from engaging in municipal securities business with an issuer for two years if certain political contributions are made to officials of that issuer.

#### Rule G-42 (Duties of Non-Solicitor Municipal Advisors)

Rule G-42 outlines the obligations of municipal advisors, including their fiduciary duties to municipal entity clients. This rule ensures that municipal advisors act in the best interests of their clients, providing advice that is free from conflicts of interest.

### Professional Qualification Requirements

To ensure that professionals in the municipal securities market are knowledgeable and competent, the MSRB has established professional qualification requirements. These include examinations such as the Series 52 for Municipal Securities Representatives and the Series 53 for Municipal Securities Principals. These exams test individuals on their understanding of municipal securities regulations and practices.

### Municipal Advisor Regulation

#### Definition

A municipal advisor is an individual or firm that provides advice to or on behalf of municipal entities regarding municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities. Municipal advisors play a critical role in helping municipal entities navigate the complexities of the securities market.

#### Registration and Compliance

Municipal advisors must register with both the SEC and the MSRB. They are required to adhere to MSRB rules specific to municipal advisors, ensuring that they operate with integrity and transparency.

### Significance for the SIE Exam

Understanding the role of the MSRB and its rules is crucial for the SIE Exam. You should be familiar with how the MSRB interacts with other regulatory bodies, the key rules affecting municipal securities activities, and the professional qualification requirements for municipal securities professionals. This knowledge will not only help you succeed in the exam but also prepare you for a career in the securities industry.
