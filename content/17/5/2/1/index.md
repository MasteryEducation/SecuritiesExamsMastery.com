## 5.2.1 FINRA Rules and Bylaws

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) plays a pivotal role in the U.S. securities industry, ensuring that broker-dealers operate with integrity and transparency. As an aspiring securities professional preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam, understanding FINRA's structure, authority, and key rules is crucial. This section provides a comprehensive overview of FINRA, its functions, and its impact on the securities industry.

### Overview of FINRA

FINRA is an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization (SRO) authorized by Congress to oversee U.S. broker-dealers. Its primary mission is to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the securities markets. By regulating and enforcing rules, FINRA aims to foster a fair and transparent financial environment.

#### FINRA’s Structure and Authority

FINRA operates under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is responsible for regulating its members, which include all broker-dealers and registered representatives operating in the U.S. securities industry. Below are the key components of FINRA's structure and authority:

- **Membership:** All broker-dealers and registered representatives must register with FINRA to operate legally in the securities industry. This registration ensures that all participants adhere to a standardized set of rules and ethical guidelines.

- **Rulemaking:** FINRA creates and enforces rules that govern the ethical activities of its members. These rules are designed to maintain high standards of commercial honor and equitable principles of trade.

- **Examination and Enforcement:** FINRA conducts regular examinations of member firms to ensure compliance with its rules. If violations are found, FINRA has the authority to impose fines, suspensions, or even bar individuals from the industry.

- **Dispute Resolution:** FINRA provides arbitration and mediation services to resolve disputes between investors and member firms. This process offers an efficient and cost-effective alternative to litigation.

#### Key FINRA Rules and Bylaws

Understanding the key rules and bylaws enforced by FINRA is essential for anyone preparing for the SIE Exam. These rules ensure that broker-dealers operate ethically and transparently, protecting both investors and the integrity of the market.

##### Conduct Rules

- **Rule 2111 (Suitability):** This rule mandates that any investment recommendation made by a broker-dealer must be suitable based on the customer's investment profile. This includes factors such as the customer's financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.

- **Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public):** This rule sets standards for advertisements, sales literature, and other communications with the public. It ensures that all communications are fair, balanced, and not misleading.

##### Uniform Practice Code (UPC)

The Uniform Practice Code establishes procedures for the settlement of securities transactions between members. It includes rules related to delivery, payment, and transfer instructions, ensuring that transactions are completed efficiently and accurately.

##### Code of Procedure

The Code of Procedure outlines the process for disciplinary proceedings against members for violations of FINRA rules. This ensures that any misconduct is addressed promptly and fairly, maintaining the integrity of the securities industry.

##### Code of Arbitration Procedure

The Code of Arbitration Procedure provides the framework for arbitration proceedings involving disputes between investors and member firms. This process offers a streamlined and cost-effective alternative to court litigation.
