## 5.4.1 Statutory Disqualification

Statutory disqualification is a critical concept within the securities industry, affecting both individuals and firms. Understanding its implications is essential for compliance and maintaining the integrity of the financial markets. This section will provide a comprehensive overview of statutory disqualification, including its definition, regulatory framework, implications, common disqualifying events, firm responsibilities, and consequences of non-compliance.

### Definition of Statutory Disqualification

Statutory disqualification refers to a status where an individual or firm is prohibited or restricted from associating with a member firm due to certain legal or regulatory violations. This status is designed to protect the integrity of the securities industry by ensuring that individuals and firms with a history of misconduct are not allowed to participate without thorough review and approval.

#### Key Aspects:

- **Prohibition or Restriction:** Individuals or firms under statutory disqualification cannot associate with a FINRA member firm in any capacity unless they receive explicit approval.
- **Legal and Regulatory Violations:** Disqualifying events include felony convictions, certain misdemeanor convictions, court injunctions, suspensions, expulsions from self-regulatory organizations (SROs), and violations of securities laws.

### Regulatory Framework

The regulatory framework governing statutory disqualification is primarily established under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and FINRA rules. These regulations outline the events that lead to disqualification and the procedures for seeking eligibility to associate with member firms.

#### Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 3(a)(39)

- **Definition and Disqualifying Events:** This section defines statutory disqualification and enumerates the events that trigger disqualification, such as criminal convictions and regulatory actions.
- **Legal Foundation:** It serves as the legal foundation for determining who is subject to disqualification and under what circumstances.

#### FINRA Rule 9520 Series

- **Eligibility Proceedings:** This series of rules establishes the procedures for eligibility proceedings, allowing individuals or firms subject to statutory disqualification to apply for permission to associate with a FINRA member firm.
- **Application Process:** Involves filing a Membership Continuance Application (MC-400) and undergoing a thorough review by FINRA.

### Implications for Individuals and Firms

Statutory disqualification has significant implications for both individuals and firms within the securities industry. It affects employment opportunities, compliance obligations, and the overall reputation of the parties involved.

#### Ineligibility to Associate

- **Prohibition:** Individuals or firms under statutory disqualification cannot be associated with a FINRA member firm without obtaining approval through the eligibility proceedings process.
- **Membership Continuance Application (MC-400):** This application is required to seek approval for a disqualified individual to associate with a member firm.

#### Eligibility Proceedings

- **Sponsorship by Firms:** A firm may choose to sponsor a statutorily disqualified individual by filing an application with FINRA. This involves a detailed review of the individual's background, the nature of the disqualification, and the firm's supervision plans.
- **FINRA Review:** FINRA considers various factors, including the individual's role within the firm, the nature of the disqualifying event, and any corrective measures taken.

### Common Disqualifying Events

Understanding the events that lead to statutory disqualification is crucial for both individuals and firms to maintain compliance and avoid potential pitfalls.

#### Criminal Convictions

- **Felony Convictions:** Any felony conviction within the past ten years can lead to disqualification, especially those involving securities, theft, fraud, or dishonesty.
- **Certain Misdemeanor Convictions:** Misdemeanor convictions related to securities or financial misconduct can also result in disqualification.

#### Regulatory Actions

- **Expulsion or Suspension:** Being expelled or suspended from membership in an SRO or commodities exchange is a disqualifying event.
- **Denial or Revocation of Registration:** The denial or revocation of registration by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) triggers disqualification.

#### Court Injunctions and Orders

- **Injunctions Involving Unlawful Activities:** Temporary or permanent injunctions related to unlawful investment activities can lead to disqualification.

### Firm Responsibilities

Firms have a responsibility to ensure compliance with statutory disqualification regulations. This involves conducting due diligence, accurate reporting, and implementing appropriate supervision measures.

#### Due Diligence

- **Background Checks:** Firms must conduct thorough background checks on prospective employees to identify any disqualifying events.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that any new disqualifying events are promptly identified and addressed.

#### Disclosure

- **Form U4 Reporting:** Firms must accurately report disqualifying events on Form U4 and update the information promptly if new events occur.
- **Transparency:** Maintaining transparency in reporting helps avoid regulatory scrutiny and potential penalties.

#### Supervision

- **Heightened Supervision Plans:** For individuals approved to associate despite disqualification, firms must implement heightened supervision plans to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.
- **Regular Reviews:** Regular reviews of supervision plans are necessary to adapt to any changes in the individual's role or regulatory requirements.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

Failure to comply with statutory disqualification regulations can result in severe consequences for both individuals and firms. These consequences underscore the importance of adherence to regulatory requirements.

#### Enforcement Actions

- **Disciplinary Actions:** Firms and individuals may face disciplinary actions, including fines, suspensions, or expulsion, for associating with statutorily disqualified persons without proper approval.
- **Reputational Damage:** Non-compliance can lead to reputational damage, affecting the firm's ability to attract clients and maintain trust within the industry.

### Glossary
