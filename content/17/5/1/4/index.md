## 5.1.4 Investment Advisers Act of 1940

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is a cornerstone of U.S. securities regulation, designed to oversee the activities of investment advisers and protect investors through stringent requirements and standards. Understanding this Act is crucial for aspiring securities professionals preparing for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the Act, its key provisions, and its significance in the regulatory framework.

### Purpose and Overview

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was enacted to regulate individuals and firms that provide investment advice for compensation. The primary goal is to protect investors by ensuring that advisers act in their clients' best interests and disclose all material information. This Act establishes a framework for the registration and regulation of investment advisers, setting forth fiduciary duties and prohibiting fraudulent practices.

### Definition of Investment Adviser

To determine who qualifies as an investment adviser under the Act, a **Three-Part Test** is applied:

1. **Provides Advice or Analyses About Securities:** The individual or firm must offer advice, reports, or analyses concerning securities.
2. **Is in the Business of Providing Such Services:** The entity must be engaged in the business of providing these advisory services.
3. **Receives Compensation for Those Services:** Compensation can be in various forms, including fees, commissions, or other economic benefits.

This definition ensures that a broad range of advisory activities are covered, capturing those who might influence investment decisions.

### Registration Requirements

Investment advisers must register either with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state securities authorities, depending on their assets under management (AUM):

- **Federal Registration:** Advisers with AUM exceeding $110 million are required to register with the SEC.
- **State Registration:** Advisers with AUM under $100 million typically register with the state securities authorities.

#### Exemptions and Exclusions

Certain professionals and entities are exempt or excluded from registration:

- **Professionals Providing Incidental Advice:** Lawyers, accountants, and other professionals who provide investment advice as an incidental part of their practice are excluded.
- **Advisers to Insurance Companies:** Those advising solely insurance companies may be exempt.
- **Advisers Solely to Venture Capital Funds:** These advisers are also exempt from registration.

### Fiduciary Duty

Investment advisers owe a fiduciary duty to their clients, which is a fundamental principle under the Act. This duty requires advisers to:

- **Act in the Best Interests of Clients:** Advisers must prioritize their clients' interests above their own.
- **Provide Full and Fair Disclosure:** Advisers must disclose all material facts, particularly those relating to conflicts of interest.

This fiduciary duty is a critical aspect of the adviser-client relationship, ensuring trust and transparency.

### Key Provisions

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 includes several key provisions that advisers must adhere to:

#### Form ADV

Investment advisers must file Form ADV with the SEC or state authorities. This form provides detailed information about the adviser's business, practices, and any disciplinary history. It is a crucial document for regulatory compliance and client transparency.

#### Brochure Rule

Under the Brochure Rule, advisers are required to deliver a disclosure document, commonly known as the "brochure," to clients. This document outlines the services offered, fees charged, disciplinary events, and potential conflicts of interest.

#### Recordkeeping Requirements

Advisers must maintain accurate books and records for a specified period. These records are essential for regulatory inspections and ensuring compliance with the Act.

#### Advertising Rules

The Act prohibits advertisements that contain untrue statements or misleading claims. Advisers must ensure that all promotional materials are truthful and not deceptive.

#### Custody Rule

Advisers with custody of client assets must adhere to specific requirements to safeguard those assets. This includes maintaining client funds in separate accounts and undergoing annual audits.

### Prohibited Practices

The Act outlines several prohibited practices to prevent fraudulent activities:

#### Fraudulent Activities

Advisers are prohibited from engaging in deceitful conduct, including misrepresentation and omission of material facts. This prohibition is vital for maintaining investor trust and market integrity.

#### Performance Fees

Generally, performance fees are prohibited unless the client is a "qualified client" who meets certain financial thresholds. This restriction prevents advisers from taking excessive risks to earn higher fees.

### Enforcement and Penalties

The SEC has the authority to enforce the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Penalties for non-compliance can include fines, suspension, or revocation of registration. Advisers may also face civil liability for breaches of fiduciary duty.
