## 5.1.2 Securities Exchange Act of 1934

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is a cornerstone of U.S. financial regulation, establishing the framework for the secondary trading of securities. This Act was pivotal in restoring investor confidence following the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. It created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a regulatory body tasked with enforcing federal securities laws and overseeing the securities industry. Understanding the Exchange Act is crucial for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam, as it forms the basis for many regulatory practices and investor protections in the U.S. securities markets.

### Purpose and Overview

The primary purpose of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is to regulate the secondary trading of securities, ensuring transparency, fairness, and integrity in the markets. It aims to protect investors by mandating continuous disclosure of material information and by preventing fraudulent activities in the securities markets.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Regulate Secondary Markets:** The Act governs the trading of securities after they have been issued, covering exchanges, broker-dealers, and over-the-counter markets.
- **Establish the SEC:** The Act created the SEC to enforce securities laws, oversee market participants, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Mandate Disclosure:** Public companies must provide regular updates on their financial condition and significant events through periodic filings.
- **Prevent Fraud:** The Act includes provisions to combat fraud, manipulation, and insider trading in the securities markets.

### Key Provisions

#### Regulation of Exchanges and Broker-Dealers

The Exchange Act requires the registration of securities exchanges, brokers, and dealers with the SEC. This registration ensures that these entities adhere to regulatory standards and operate in a manner that protects investors.

- **Exchanges:** Must register with the SEC and comply with rules designed to maintain fair and orderly markets.
- **Broker-Dealers:** Required to register and are subject to regulations regarding their conduct, financial responsibility, and recordkeeping.

#### Continuous Disclosure Requirements

Public companies are obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC, providing transparency and enabling investors to make informed decisions. These reports include:

- **Form 10-K:** An annual report detailing the company's financial performance.
- **Form 10-Q:** A quarterly update on financial results.
- **Form 8-K:** A report filed for significant events that may affect the company's financial position or operations.

#### Antifraud Provisions

**Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5** are critical components of the Exchange Act, prohibiting fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative practices in securities trading.

- **Section 10(b):** Outlaws any manipulative or deceptive device in the trading of securities.
- **Rule 10b-5:** Specifically prohibits making false statements or omitting material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

#### Proxy Solicitations

The Act regulates proxy solicitations to ensure that shareholders receive accurate and complete information when voting on corporate matters. This regulation promotes fairness and transparency in the voting process.

#### Insider Trading Regulations

The Exchange Act defines illegal insider trading and establishes penalties for violations. Insider trading involves buying or selling securities based on material, non-public information, which undermines market integrity.

#### Tender Offer Regulations

Tender offers are public bids to purchase shares from existing shareholders, often at a premium. The Act sets rules to protect investors from coercive or unfair practices during these offers.

### Establishment of the SEC

The SEC is the primary enforcer of federal securities laws, with broad authority to oversee the securities industry. It plays a crucial role in maintaining market integrity and protecting investors.

**Functions of the SEC:**

- **Enforce Securities Laws:** The SEC investigates violations and takes enforcement actions against individuals and entities that breach securities laws.
- **Oversee SROs:** The SEC supervises self-regulatory organizations (SROs) like FINRA and securities exchanges.
- **Review Corporate Filings:** Ensures that public companies comply with disclosure requirements.

**Divisions of the SEC:**

- **Division of Corporation Finance:** Oversees corporate disclosure of important information to investors.
- **Division of Trading and Markets:** Establishes and maintains standards for fair, orderly, and efficient markets.
- **Division of Investment Management:** Regulates investment companies and advisers.
- **Division of Enforcement:** Investigates and prosecutes violations of securities laws.
- **Division of Economic and Risk Analysis:** Provides economic and risk analysis to support the SEC's activities.

### Investor Protections

The Exchange Act includes several provisions designed to protect investors and ensure fair practices in the securities markets.

#### Short-Swing Profit Rule (Section 16(b))

This rule requires insiders—such as officers, directors, and large shareholders—to disgorge any profits made from buying and selling company stock within a six-month period. This discourages insider trading and aligns insiders' interests with long-term company performance.

#### Regulation of Margin Trading

**Regulation T:** Grants the Federal Reserve Board authority to set margin requirements for securities transactions. This regulation aims to prevent excessive borrowing that could destabilize financial markets.

### Significance for the SIE Exam

Understanding the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is essential for the SIE Exam, as it forms the foundation of U.S. securities regulation. Key areas of focus include:

- **Regulation of Secondary Markets:** Recognize how the Act governs the trading of securities after issuance.
- **Role of the SEC:** Understand the SEC's authority and functions in enforcing securities laws.
- **Reporting Requirements:** Be familiar with the types of reports public companies must file and their significance.
- **Antifraud Provisions:** Know the importance of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in preventing fraud and manipulation.

### Glossary

- **Secondary Market:** The marketplace where investors buy and sell securities from other investors, rather than from issuing companies.
- **10-K, 10-Q, 8-K Reports:** Periodic filings required by the SEC providing annual, quarterly, and significant event information, respectively.
- **Insider Trading:** Trading of a company's securities by individuals with access to material, non-public information.
- **Tender Offer:** A public offer to buy shares from existing shareholders, usually at a premium over the market price.
