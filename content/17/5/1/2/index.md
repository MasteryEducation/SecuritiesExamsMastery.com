## 5.1.2 Securities Exchange Act of 1934

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is a cornerstone of U.S. financial regulation, governing the secondary trading of securities such as stocks, bonds, and debentures. This Act established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which plays a pivotal role in regulating and overseeing the securities industry. As you prepare for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam, understanding the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is crucial for grasping how the secondary markets operate and how they are regulated.

### Purpose and Overview

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was enacted to govern the trading of securities after they have been issued, ensuring transparency, fairness, and efficiency in the secondary markets. It aims to protect investors by requiring ongoing disclosure of significant financial information and by prohibiting fraudulent activities in the securities markets.

#### Establishment of the SEC

A significant outcome of the Act was the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an independent federal agency tasked with enforcing federal securities laws and regulating securities markets. The SEC's primary functions include overseeing securities exchanges, broker-dealers, investment advisors, and mutual funds. It also plays a crucial role in maintaining fair and efficient markets and facilitating capital formation.

### Key Provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

#### Regulation of Exchanges and Broker-Dealers

The Act mandates the registration of securities exchanges, brokers, and dealers with the SEC. This registration process ensures that these entities comply with regulatory standards and operate transparently. By regulating these market participants, the SEC aims to prevent fraudulent practices and protect investors.

#### Continuous Disclosure Requirements

Public companies are required under the Act to file periodic reports with the SEC, such as the annual Form 10-K, quarterly Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. These filings provide investors with essential information about a company's financial condition, operations, and significant events, enabling informed investment decisions.

#### Antifraud Provisions

The antifraud provisions of the Act are among its most critical components. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are particularly significant, as they prohibit fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative practices in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. These provisions form the basis for legal actions against insider trading and other fraudulent activities in the securities markets.

#### Proxy Solicitations

The Act regulates the solicitation of proxies to ensure transparency and fairness in shareholder voting processes. Companies must provide shareholders with sufficient information to make informed decisions about corporate governance matters.

#### Insider Trading Regulations

The Act defines illegal insider trading as the buying or selling of a security by someone who has access to material, non-public information about the security. Violations of insider trading laws can result in severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

#### Tender Offer Regulations

Tender offers are public proposals to buy shares from existing shareholders, usually at a premium over the market price. The Act establishes rules for tender offers to protect investors from coercive or unfair practices, ensuring that all shareholders receive fair treatment.

### Establishment and Functions of the SEC

The SEC is organized into several divisions, each responsible for specific aspects of securities regulation:

- **Division of Corporation Finance:** Oversees corporate disclosure of important information to the investing public.
- **Division of Trading and Markets:** Establishes and maintains standards for fair, orderly, and efficient markets.
- **Division of Investment Management:** Regulates investment companies, including mutual funds, and investment advisors.
- **Division of Enforcement:** Investigates and prosecutes violations of securities laws.
- **Division of Economic and Risk Analysis:** Provides economic and risk analysis to support the SEC's regulatory activities.

The SEC's role in enforcing securities laws and overseeing self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as FINRA and exchanges, is vital to maintaining investor confidence and market integrity.

### Investor Protections

#### Short-Swing Profit Rule (Section 16(b))

This rule requires insiders—such as officers, directors, and large shareholders—to disgorge profits made from buying and selling company stock within a six-month period. This provision aims to prevent insiders from exploiting their access to material, non-public information for personal gain.

#### Regulation of Margin Trading

**Regulation T** grants the Federal Reserve Board authority to set margin requirements for securities transactions. Margin trading involves borrowing funds to purchase securities, and Regulation T ensures that such transactions are conducted safely and prudently.

### Significance for the SIE Exam

For the SIE Exam, it is essential to understand how the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates secondary markets and market participants. Key areas of focus include the role and authority of the SEC, reporting requirements, antifraud provisions, and investor protections. Familiarity with these concepts will help you navigate questions related to securities regulation and compliance.

### Glossary

- **Secondary Market:** The marketplace where investors buy and sell securities from other investors, rather than from issuing companies.
