## 5.5.1 Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)

Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) represents a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for broker-dealers and their associated persons. Enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Reg BI became effective on June 30, 2020, and aims to enhance the standard of conduct for broker-dealers when they recommend securities transactions or investment strategies to retail customers. This section provides a comprehensive overview of Reg BI, its key obligations, and its implications for the securities industry.

### Overview of Regulation Best Interest

Reg BI establishes a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers, designed to ensure that they act in the best interest of their retail customers. This regulation is part of the SEC's broader effort to increase transparency and protect investors from potential conflicts of interest that may arise in the broker-dealer-client relationship. Reg BI mandates that broker-dealers must not place their own financial interests ahead of the interests of their retail customers when making recommendations.

### Key Obligations Under Reg BI

Reg BI imposes four primary obligations on broker-dealers: Disclosure, Care, Conflict of Interest, and Compliance. Each obligation is designed to ensure that broker-dealers adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct and transparency.

#### Disclosure Obligation

- **Full and Fair Disclosure:** Broker-dealers must provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts related to the scope and terms of the relationship with their retail customers. This includes information about fees, services, and any conflicts of interest that may affect the recommendation.
- **Clarity and Accessibility:** Disclosures must be made in a manner that is clear and accessible to retail customers, ensuring that they fully understand the nature of the relationship and the services offered.

#### Care Obligation

- **Reasonable Diligence, Care, and Skill:** Broker-dealers are required to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations. This means understanding the potential risks and rewards of a product and ensuring that the recommendation is in the best interest of the customer.
- **Consideration of Costs and Alternatives:** Broker-dealers must consider the costs associated with a product and evaluate reasonable alternatives before making a recommendation. This involves a thorough analysis of the customer's investment profile and objectives.

#### Conflict of Interest Obligation

- **Identification and Disclosure:** Broker-dealers must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures to identify, disclose, and mitigate or eliminate material conflicts of interest.
- **Mitigation or Elimination:** Where possible, broker-dealers should take steps to mitigate or eliminate conflicts of interest to ensure that they do not adversely affect the recommendation made to the retail customer.

#### Compliance Obligation

- **Policies and Procedures:** Broker-dealers must develop and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI. This includes regular reviews and updates to ensure ongoing adherence to regulatory standards.
- **Training and Monitoring:** Firms should implement training programs and monitoring systems to ensure that all associated persons are aware of their obligations under Reg BI and are acting in compliance with the regulation.

### Form CRS (Customer Relationship Summary)

Form CRS is a critical component of Reg BI, designed to provide retail investors with a simple and easy-to-understand summary of the relationship and services offered by a broker-dealer.

#### Requirement

- **Mandatory Disclosure:** Firms must provide Form CRS to retail investors, outlining the nature of the relationship and the services offered. This form is intended to enhance transparency and help investors make informed decisions.

#### Content

- **Comprehensive Information:** Form CRS includes information about the firm's services, fees, conflicts of interest, legal standards, and disciplinary history. It is designed to be concise and written in plain language to ensure that it is accessible to all retail investors.

### Applicability

Reg BI applies specifically to recommendations made to retail customers. A retail customer is defined as an individual who uses the recommendation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, as well as their legal representatives. This broad definition ensures that a wide range of individuals are protected under the regulation.

### Distinction from Suitability Standard

Reg BI imposes a higher standard than the previous FINRA suitability rule. While the suitability rule required broker-dealers to ensure that a recommendation was suitable for a customer based on their investment profile, Reg BI goes further by requiring that broker-dealers act in the best interest of the customer without placing their own interests ahead of the customer's.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with Reg BI can result in significant consequences for broker-dealers and their associated persons.

#### Regulatory Enforcement

- **SEC Enforcement Actions:** The SEC has the authority to bring enforcement actions against firms and individuals who violate Reg BI. This can include investigations, fines, and other penalties.

#### Disciplinary Actions

- **Fines and Sanctions:** Firms and individuals found to be in violation of Reg BI may face fines, suspension, or other disciplinary actions. These consequences underscore the importance of adhering to the regulation and maintaining high ethical standards.

### Glossary

- **Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI):** An SEC regulation establishing a standard of conduct requiring broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail customers when making recommendations.
- **Form CRS:** A disclosure document summarizing the customer relationship and services offered by a broker-dealer.
