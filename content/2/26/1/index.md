## 26.1 Investment Calculation Worksheets

Investing is not just about choosing the right stocks or bonds; it's also about understanding the numbers behind your decisions. Investment calculation worksheets are essential tools that help you quantify and evaluate your financial strategies. This section provides you with practical worksheets and templates for calculating investment returns, compound interest, retirement needs, and other financial metrics. These tools are designed to empower you to make informed decisions and confidently manage your investment portfolio.

### Understanding Investment Calculations

Before diving into the worksheets, it's important to have a basic understanding of the key financial metrics you'll be working with:

- **Investment Returns**: The gain or loss on an investment over a specified period, expressed as a percentage of the investment's initial cost.
- **Compound Interest**: The process of earning interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.
- **Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV)**: PV is the current value of a sum of money, while FV is the value of that sum at a specified date in the future, based on a certain interest rate.
- **Retirement Needs**: The amount of money required to maintain your desired lifestyle during retirement.

### Practical Worksheets and Templates

#### 1. **Investment Return Calculation Worksheet**

This worksheet helps you calculate the return on investment (ROI) for individual assets or your entire portfolio. ROI is a key metric for assessing the performance of your investments.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Initial Investment**: Enter the amount you initially invested.
2. **Input Final Value**: Enter the current or final value of the investment.
3. **Calculate ROI**: Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{ROI} = \left(\frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}}\right) \times 100
   {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If you invested $5,000 in a stock and its value increased to $6,000, your ROI would be:

{{< katex >}}
\text{ROI} = \left(\frac{6,000 - 5,000}{5,000}\right) \times 100 = 20\%
{{< /katex >}}

#### 2. **Compound Interest Worksheet**

Compound interest is a powerful concept that can significantly impact your investment growth over time. This worksheet helps you calculate the future value of an investment based on compound interest.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Principal Amount**: Enter the initial amount of money invested.
2. **Input Interest Rate**: Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage).
3. **Input Number of Compounding Periods**: Enter the number of times the interest is compounded per year.
4. **Input Time in Years**: Enter the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.
5. **Calculate Future Value**: Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{FV} = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{n \times t}
   {{< /katex >}}

   Where:
   - \\( P \\) = Principal amount
   - \\( r \\) = Annual interest rate (decimal)
   - \\( n \\) = Number of compounding periods per year
   - \\( t \\) = Time in years

**Example:**

If you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded quarterly for 10 years, the future value is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{FV} = 1,000 \times \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{4}\right)^{4 \times 10} \approx 1,648.62
{{< /katex >}}

#### 3. **Retirement Needs Calculation Worksheet**

Planning for retirement requires understanding how much money you will need to maintain your desired lifestyle. This worksheet helps you estimate your retirement needs.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Current Annual Expenses**: Enter your current annual expenses.
2. **Estimate Retirement Duration**: Enter the number of years you expect to be in retirement.
3. **Input Expected Inflation Rate**: Enter the expected annual inflation rate.
4. **Input Expected Rate of Return**: Enter the expected annual return on your retirement savings.
5. **Calculate Future Expenses**: Adjust your current expenses for inflation over the retirement duration.
6. **Calculate Required Retirement Savings**: Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Required Savings} = \frac{\text{Future Expenses} \times (1 - (1 + r)^{-t})}{r}
   {{< /katex >}}

   Where:
   - \\( r \\) = Expected rate of return (decimal)
   - \\( t \\) = Retirement duration in years

**Example:**

If your current annual expenses are $50,000, you expect to be in retirement for 30 years, with an inflation rate of 3% and an expected return of 5%, your required savings would be calculated accordingly.

#### 4. **Present Value and Future Value Worksheet**

Understanding the present and future value of money is crucial for making informed investment decisions. This worksheet helps you calculate both PV and FV.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Future Value**: Enter the amount you expect to receive in the future.
2. **Input Interest Rate**: Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage).
3. **Input Time in Years**: Enter the number of years until the future value is received.
4. **Calculate Present Value**: Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{PV} = \frac{\text{FV}}{(1 + r)^t}
   {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If you expect to receive $10,000 in 5 years with an interest rate of 4%, the present value is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{PV} = \frac{10,000}{(1 + 0.04)^5} \approx 8,219.27
{{< /katex >}}

#### 5. **Investment Performance Analysis Worksheet**

This worksheet is designed to help you analyze the performance of your investment portfolio over time, considering both returns and risks.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Portfolio Value at Start and End**: Enter the value of your portfolio at the beginning and end of the period.
2. **Input Cash Flows**: Enter any additional contributions or withdrawals during the period.
3. **Calculate Portfolio Return**: Use the formula:

   {{< katex >}}
   \text{Portfolio Return} = \frac{\text{Ending Value} - \text{Starting Value} + \text{Withdrawals} - \text{Contributions}}{\text{Starting Value} + \text{Contributions}}
   {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

If your portfolio started at $100,000, ended at $120,000, and you made no additional contributions or withdrawals, your return is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Portfolio Return} = \frac{120,000 - 100,000}{100,000} = 20\%
{{< /katex >}}

- [x] \(\text{ROI} = \left(\frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}}\right) \times 100\)
- [ ] \(\text{ROI} = \left(\frac{\text{Initial Investment} - \text{Final Value}}{\text{Final Value}}\right) \times 100\)
- [ ] \(\text{ROI} = \left(\frac{\text{Final Value} \times \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}}\right) \times 100\)
- [ ] \(\text{ROI} = \left(\frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Final Value}}\right) \times 100\)

> **Explanation:** ROI is calculated by dividing the difference between the final value and the initial investment by the initial investment, then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.


### What is the effect of compounding on the future value of an investment?

- [x] Increases the future value
- [ ] Decreases the future value
- [ ] Has no effect on the future value
- [ ] Only affects the principal amount

> **Explanation:** Compounding increases the future value of an investment by earning interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.
