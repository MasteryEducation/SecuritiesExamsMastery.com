### Overview of the NASDAQ Composite

The NASDAQ Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that includes nearly all the stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. With over 3,000 companies, it provides a comprehensive view of the market, particularly reflecting the performance of the technology sector. The NASDAQ Composite is often viewed as a barometer for the health and direction of the tech industry, given its significant weighting toward technology-related stocks.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Tech-Heavy Focus:** The index is heavily skewed towards technology firms, including giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as numerous smaller tech startups.
- **Growth Orientation:** Many of the companies in the NASDAQ Composite are considered growth companies, which are expected to expand at a faster rate than the overall market.

### Composition of the NASDAQ Composite

The NASDAQ Composite is known for its diversity, including a wide range of industries beyond technology, such as biotechnology, consumer services, and financial services. However, its core strength and identity lie in its technology sector representation.

#### Market Capitalization-Weighted:

- **Calculation Method:** The index is calculated by taking the sum of the market capitalizations of all the included securities, adjusted by a specific divisor.
