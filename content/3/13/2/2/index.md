The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) plays a crucial role in the U.S. securities industry, acting as a self-regulatory organization (SRO) that oversees broker-dealers and their agents. FINRA's mission is to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the securities markets. By enforcing ethical conduct and compliance with industry standards, FINRA helps maintain a fair and transparent market environment. This section will delve into FINRA's responsibilities, tools, and resources, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of its impact on the securities industry.

### Understanding FINRA's Role

#### What is FINRA?

**Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**: A non-governmental organization that regulates member brokerage firms and exchange markets. As an SRO, FINRA operates independently of the government but under the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It was created in 2007 through the consolidation of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the regulatory functions of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
